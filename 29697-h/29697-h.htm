<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE FORBIDDEN PASTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>She sat hunched up in the middle of the silent pasture,
where the tall, thin grass ran ripening before
the breeze in waves the hue of burnished bronze. Her
cow pony grazed greedily a few yards away, lifting his
head now and then to gaze inquiringly at her, and then
returning to his gluttony with a satisfied snort, commendatory
of this long rest. The girl had removed her
small sombrero to adjust the masses of tawny hair that
had become disordered in her morning ride; and the
breeze now played with it, and the sun sought out its
glints of gold. She was fair, of a curiously rich complexion
with soft golden tints beneath the skin, as if the
rusty gold in her hair was just the outcropping of what
ran in solution in her veins. And there was a certain
air about her that contrasted strangely with the scene
upon which she now gazed intently, with her head bent
forward, and her hands clasped round her upthrust
knees.</p>
<p>It was a little valley she had come upon by chance,
snugly tucked away among the hills. Below the bronze-colored
slope there were lush meadows of a brilliant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
green, and a shallow, swift stream that flashed over
black bowlders and white sand; beyond the meadows lay
more shining pastures rising to pale-green aspen groves
and then to dark-green pines; and above all these the
foothills climbed swiftly to the mountains, and the
mountains more swiftly to the sky. There were faint
blue mists in the foothills, fainter violet shadows on the
distant fields, an icy whiteness on the peaks; and in the
sky no more than two small puffs of cloud like eiderdown
adrift in the depths of blue. What at first had
seemed an utter silence laid upon that summer landscape
had now become, as she looked and listened, a
silence full of sound; of that indefinable humming
undertone of nature maturing in the sun; of insects
busy at their harvest; of birds in the distance calling;
of grasses rustling in the breeze; of pines on the long
ridge droning like an organ in the Recessional.</p>
<p>Yes, it was very beautiful, she thought. And sweet.
And peaceful. She had come a long way&ndash;&ndash;halfway
across the great continent&ndash;&ndash;to find that peace. But
why should there be a touch of sadness in all that
beauty? And why should there be need to search for
her handkerchief to press against her eyes? For the
first time since she had come to Paradise Park she felt
a little lonely, a little doubtful about the wisdom of her
brave revolt.</p>
<p>She sank back at last, and lay curled up in the grass
with her head pillowed on one bent arm. There, to her
half-closed eyes, the grass seemed like a fairy forest,
soon peopled by her fancy, the fancy of a girl who still
retained the quick imagination of a child. An Indian
paintbrush flamed at her with barbaric passion; nodding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
harebells tinkled purple melodies; and a Mariposa lily
with a violet eye seemed like a knight in white armor,
bowing himself into her outstretched hand. Her eyelids
drooped more and more. The music of the pines
and the murmur of the pasture blended in a faint and
fading lullaby....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s shrill neigh awakened her. She sat up
shivering, for the warm air was underlaid with cold;
and quivering, for the alarm had fallen pat upon the
climax of her dream. She rubbed her eyes, a little
blinded by the sunlight, and saw that Tuesday stood
with head high and nostrils distended, gazing past her
toward the upper end of the pasture. She was not surprised,
being yet under the spell of her dream-fairyland,
to see a horseman galloping straight toward her. If not
the white knight, then&ndash;&ndash;For some seconds she stared,
awakening slowly; and smiled at length at her childish
fancy. It was only a cowboy, doubtless, riding upon his
own prosaic business. And yet&ndash;&ndash;She became gradually
aware of something unusual, something disquieting
in the manner of the man&rsquo;s approach. The horse was
leaping under the spurs; the rider sat upright and alert
in the saddle; and suddenly, as she watched him, the
man&rsquo;s hand went to his hip, and there was a gleam of
metal in the sun.</p>
<p>She was not afraid. Seth Huntington had assured
her there was nothing to be feared in Paradise Park.
But for all that, it was not without uneasiness that she
hastily arranged the meager folds of her divided skirt,
and passed her hands quickly over the still disordered
masses of her hair. And then he was fairly upon her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
reining up with a jerk that brought the sweating pony
back upon its haunches.</p>
<p>There was an angry glitter in the man&rsquo;s dark eyes, his
face was black with passion, and the bright object she
had seen flashing in his hand was the twin brother
of Huntington&rsquo;s six-shooter. He was roughly, even
meanly, dressed. His coarse blue flannel shirt was unbuttoned
at the throat; his soiled brown corduroy
trousers were thrust unevenly into dusty and wrinkled
boot tops; his old, gray hat was slouched over one side
of his forehead, shading his eyes. But the face beneath
that faded and disreputable hat, as Marion saw with a
slight thrill of curiosity, belonged to no ranch hand or
cow-puncher. Whoever he might be, and whatever he
might be doing there scowling at her, she felt at once
that he was as foreign as herself to that neighborhood.
But there was no time at that moment to analyze her
feeling, to formulate her thought. And her next impression,
following very swiftly, was one of vague antagonism.
She felt that she was going to hate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What new trick is this?&rdquo; he demanded angrily,
when he had looked from the girl to her pony, and at
her again, with unconcealed suspicion.</p>
<p>For a moment she was undecided whether to answer
him sharply or to rebuke his incivility with silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; she replied at last, by way of compromise
between her two impulses, with a half-playful
emphasis on the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; accompanied by a very solemn,
shaking of the head and a very innocent widening of
the eyes.</p>
<p>There was a pause while he searched her face with a
distrustful scrutiny.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not just the person I was looking for,&rdquo; he
said finally, with a touch of irony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fortunate!&rdquo; she replied, in a tone that was
like a mocking echo of his own.</p>
<p>Her eyes met his unflinchingly, a little impudently,
telling him nothing; then they slowly fell, and rested on
the revolver in his hand. With a shrug he thrust the
weapon into its holster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;You really won&rsquo;t
need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jerked his head impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get in here?&rdquo; he demanded, quite as
roughly as before.</p>
<p>There was no reason in the world why she should not
have answered him simply and directly; but she did not.
She was exasperated, not so much by his words as by
his manner, and not so much by his manner even as by
something provocative in the man himself. He was
rude, but it was not his rudeness that most annoyed her.
She scarcely knew what it was,&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a certain indifference,
a certain cold contempt that she detected
underlying all his anger, a certain icy and impenetrable
reserve that, for all his hot words, and for all his lowering
looks, she resented most as being in some way
personal to her. And instantly the minx in her rose up
for mischief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By aeroplane, of course!&rdquo; she said tartly.</p>
<p>It was a silly speech, and she regretted it almost before
it had left her lips.</p>
<p>A faint flush came into the enemy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a woman!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Always
tragic over little things and flippant over big ones.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>That brought the color up into her face. But she was
not subdued; for the cat in woman also has nine lives&ndash;&ndash;at
least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my horse,&rdquo; she said, with a toss of her head.
&ldquo;You saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True! But cow ponies don&rsquo;t easily jump four-wire
fences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they when the fences are down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! We arrive by the devious ways that women
love. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll give me the answer now that you
should have given in the first place. <i>How did you get
in here?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bit her lip, reflected a moment, and attempted a
flank movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Marion Gaylord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have never seen me before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But that&rsquo;s one of Huntington&rsquo;s horses, and
Miss Gaylord is a guest at his house. You see, I am
more courteous than you after all. I answer your questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll answer yours when I know what right
you have to ask them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light began to dawn upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t know where you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her a long, searching look before he spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Philip Haig,&rdquo; he said, leaning forward
with a curious smile.</p>
<p>The result was all that he could have wished for.
Until that moment she had remained seated, firm in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
determination not to be disturbed by him. But now
she rose slowly to her feet, her face reddening, her lips
parted, a frightened look in her eyes. The shoe was on
the other foot, with a vengeance.</p>
<p>He saw all this, and without compunction, seized his
advantage. With a grim smile he threw the reins over
the pony&rsquo;s head, swung himself out of the saddle, and
stepped toward her. As he came on he removed his
dilapidated hat with a gesture that made her forget it
was dilapidated,&ndash;&ndash;a mocking, insolent gesture though it
was. In spite of her embarrassment she let none of his
features escape her quickening interest. She saw that
he was tall, erect, alert; handsome in some strange and
half-repellent way, with his pale dark face, rather long
in contour, and with his black, curly hair matted on the
broad forehead. But she almost recoiled when, on his
drawing nearer, she saw for the first time&ndash;&ndash;it had been
hidden by the shadow of his slouched hat&ndash;&ndash;an ugly scar
that ran from the outer corner of his left eye down to the
jawbone below the ear. It gave to one side of his face a
singularly sinister expression that vanished when he
turned and disclosed a profile that was not without
nobility and charm.</p>
<p>Then suddenly her mystification was complete.
Their eyes met, not as before, but very near, so close had
he come to her, still smiling. And instantly, instinctively,
she lowered hers; for she felt as if she had been
caught peering through a window at something she had
no right to see. Yet the next instant she was looking
again, half-guiltily, but irresistibly drawn. The eyes
were of a curious color,&ndash;&ndash;smoky black, or dark gray-blue,
or somber purple,&ndash;&ndash;liquid and deep like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
woman&rsquo;s, but with a steady, dull glow in their depths
that was unlike anything she had ever seen or imagined.
What was it that burned there? Suffering? Hunger?
Evil? Sorrow? Shame? It gave her something to
think about for many a day and night. Meanwhile&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have heard of me,&rdquo; he said mockingly.</p>
<p>She had no reply. She was realizing slowly that she
had trespassed, that she had perhaps seriously compromised
her cousin, and, most humiliating of all, that she
had assumed quite the wrong attitude toward the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t know you were on my land?&rdquo; he
demanded, with a little less offensiveness in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Huntington didn&rsquo;t send you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, of course. But it&rsquo;s rather queer.
How did you happen&ndash;&ndash;if you don&rsquo;t mind&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not mind in the least&ndash;&ndash;was eager, indeed, to
explain her presence there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just learning to ride,&rdquo; she began impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was my first venture off the valley road, and
I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came straight to me!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
chuckling.</p>
<p>At that a strange thing happened. He had meant
only that she, the guest and cousin of Seth Huntington,
his bitter foe, had blundered straight into the camp of
the enemy; and that was a rare joke on Huntington.
But she was a girl; her little adventure was already rosy
with romance; and the effect of his careless speech was
as if he had looked into her heart, and read aloud for
her something she had not known was there. To his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
surprise and wonder the girl&rsquo;s fair face turned red to the
roots of her tawny hair, and a look of helpless confusion
came into the clear, blue eyes that until now, for all
her embarrassment, had frankly met his own. She
looked suddenly away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me ashamed,&rdquo; she said at length, stealing
a look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know anything about my difficulty with
Huntington,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll understand that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. I do understand!&rdquo; she interrupted eagerly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about it&ndash;&ndash;the trouble. They
haven&rsquo;t told me. I&rsquo;ve only overheard some talk&ndash;&ndash;and
I didn&rsquo;t ask. I rode down the valley this morning trying
to do it like a cowboy. And there was a branch road&ndash;&ndash;and
then the break in the fence&ndash;&ndash;and before I knew
it I&rsquo;d fallen asleep. That&rsquo;s all&ndash;&ndash;except&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She shot
a half-mischievous glance at him &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;you spoiled a very
beautiful dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this was all lost upon him. His face was clouding
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it&ndash;&ndash;the break in the fence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chagrined at the failure of her bit of coquetry, she
merely pointed in the direction whence she had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went swiftly to his pony, mounted, and
started to ride away. But suddenly he reined up again,
whirled his horse savagely around, and faced Marion
with the sunlight full upon the scarred side of his face,
now ugly with menace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that fence has been cut,&rdquo; he said, in a hard and
level tone, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been cut by Huntington or his men.
You tell him for me, please&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;ll be doing <i>him</i> a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
favor not to forget it&ndash;&ndash;tell him that he&rsquo;s a fool to anger
me. I&rsquo;ve been very patient in this business, but I don&rsquo;t
claim patience as one of my virtues. Do you hear?
Tell him he&rsquo;s a fool to anger me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched him gallop to the gap in the barb-wire
fence; she watched him dismount to examine the severed
wires; she watched him leap on his horse again, and ride
furiously down the road until he was lost to view below
the dip in the slope toward the valley. And still for
some minutes she stood staring at the place where he
had disappeared. Then, left alone with her pent-up
emotions, she no longer resisted them. Tears of vexation
started in her eyes; chagrin, resentment, anger
swept over her in turn. She dug the heel of one small
boot into the unoffending soil&ndash;&ndash;his soil&ndash;&ndash;and thrust
her clenched hands down at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; she cried, over and over again, striding
forward and back across some yards of pasture,
trampling lilies and harebells under her heedless feet,
turning her flaming face at intervals toward the spot in
the smiling landscape that had last held the figure of
Philip Haig.</p>
<p>The shame of it! She had never&ndash;&ndash;never&ndash;&ndash;never
been treated so outrageously. It was unendurable&ndash;&ndash;and
she had endured it! She flung herself down on
the ground and wept.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Marion was now facing life alone. Her nearest
remaining relative was her cousin, Claire Huntington.
Her mother&ndash;&ndash;a Southern girl who might have stepped
out of a panel by Fragonard, so fine and soft and Old-World-like
was her beauty&ndash;&ndash;had died when she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
still a child. Her father, Doctor Gaylord, was the
antithesis of the sprite-like creature he had married,&ndash;&ndash;a
big, athletic, outdoor sort of man, with truly violent red
hair and beard, whose favorite expression about himself
had been that a very capable pirate had been sacrificed
to make a tolerable physician. But he had prospered
in his profession; and then had died with amazing
suddenness, leaving his estate in an almost hopeless
mess.</p>
<p>Robert Hillyer had tackled the problem,&ndash;&ndash;Robert,
the alert, the busy, the supremely confident, the typical
money-getter of the money-worshipping metropolis. He
had long been deeply in love with Marion, but he had not
made great headway in his suit, despite the advantage
of Doctor Gaylord&rsquo;s approval. Now, having saved
enough out of the estate (for so he said, though he never
told Marion the details of that miracle) to provide her
with an income barely sufficient to keep her in comfort
but not in the luxury to which she had been accustomed,
he plainly expected his reward. And this was to
Marion an intolerable situation. She did not love Robert.
She liked him, admired him, trusted him; no more.
Knowing her father&rsquo;s wishes, she saw the way marked
straight before her; for Robert already had wealth, and
could and would give her all the material things she
desired. Time and again she was on the point of yielding,
but something checked her, held her back, as if a
voice had whispered in her ear, and strong arms had
seized her. She grew restless, discontented, melancholy.
And suddenly, on a moment&rsquo;s inspiration, the
strangest impulse she had ever known, she had revolted
and fled from the scene of her unhappiness, telling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
Robert (by letter) only that she must have time to
think, and that for six months he must leave her to
herself. She had fled to Claire, that cousin on her
father&rsquo;s side, who some years before, to the wonder and
chagrin of many Gaylords east and west,&ndash;&ndash;to all except
the Viking physician, who had rejoiced in her spirit,&ndash;&ndash;had
eloped with a cowboy, since turned successful cattleman,
whom she had met at the Denver Carnival. Ten
days now had Marion been in Paradise Park, rejoicing
in her freedom, rejoicing in the half-wild life, rejoicing
in the tonic air and the tonic beauty of this Rocky Mountain
valley, shut in, isolated, and so aptly named. And
only to-day had there come any emotions that disturbed
her peace.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When she looked up again her eyes were sharply
arrested by a scene that seemed curiously to picture her
own mood. Far up at the head of the valley a cloud that
was scarcely heavier than a mist came stealing out of a
gulch to take its shining way along the range of mountains.
Dropping in its flight a shower as light as a
bridal veil, it sped glistening across the face of mountain
after mountain, softening the stark grays and reds, while
above it the peaks gleamed white. On and on it came
until at last it arrived at the mouth of a deep, dark gorge
in the side of a mountain that, in its strange and forbidding
aspect, differed notably from all the others in the
majestic range. There it paused as if arrested by some
stern command, hung for a moment in palpable agitation,
and was swiftly swallowed up in the gorge. And
again she had a vague and uneasy feeling, as she had
when first she saw it, that Thunder Mountain,&ndash;&ndash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
she could not fit that feeling into thought, could find no
words to frame it. Yet she was fascinated.</p>
<p>It was half-hidden now in surging, black storm-clouds,
while all the sharp and snow-clad peaks around it glittered
in the sun. Even in those rare moments when it
was freed from clouds and mists it stood alone in its
peculiar grandeur. Unlike all the others it wore no
diadem of snow. Some terrible convulsion of nature,
some cataclysm at its birth or in the fiery days of its
youth, had left it bald-headed, ugly, and deformed. But
for that catastrophe it would have been far loftier than
any of its fellows; and even now the hunchback towered
among them, its flat head level with their pointed peaks,
the most conspicuous figure in the imposing pageant
raised against the western sky.</p>
<p>And its deformity was not the whole of its misfortune.
It bore the brunt of every tempest that broke upon that
massive barrier of mountains. Its granite head was the
very breeding-place of storms. The peaks around it had
their days of calm, but Thunder Mountain never. An
hour or two perhaps&ndash;&ndash;no more. It knew no peace.
The elements were, and are now, and forever will be
quarreling upon its worn and battered head; lightning
and rain and snow and wind are forever hammering and
beating it turn by turn. It is the Quasimodo and the
Lear and the Gray Friar of mountains, all in one. And
if, on some still and perfect day, its tonsured head
emerges from the clouds, the watcher in the Park has
but to turn his head a moment, and look again, and lo!
it wears its gray cowl as before, and stoops growling and
grumbling under its endless punishment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as Marion looked, the silence was rudely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
shattered. Roll on roll of thunder swept across the valley,
crashed against the hills, rebounded from wall to
wall of mountains, until all the Park was filled with the
sullen bellowing. And then, amid all the tumult,
Marion heard something more,&ndash;&ndash;a voice that mingled
with the voice of the mountain, and thrilled her while it
filled her with a singular disquietude. She had dismissed
Haig from her thoughts. She was sure of that.
And yet through all the uproar, and in the tense silence
that ensued, she heard his taunting voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came straight to me!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE ROAD TO PARADISE</h3>
</div>
<p>The gap in the fence remained exactly as it had been
when it invited her to adventure. But now she
halted there, dismounted, and picked up the end of a
wire that lay trailing on the ground. With new-found
interest she examined the fracture, and stared at it in
wonder. Dropping it, and kneeling excitedly in the
grass, she searched another, and still another wire, and
with the same result. Even to her unpractised eye the
facts were plain: the four wires had not been broken;
they had been cleanly cut, and very recently, as shown
by the absence of rust on the severed ends. By whom?
And why? Seth Huntington, Haig had said. Impossible!
Absurd! True, she had heard Seth denouncing
him; Claire also; and without knowing the cause of the
feud, or caring, she had learned that Huntington and
Haig were bitterly at odds about something,&ndash;&ndash;cattle, she
thought, or was it land? But that Seth could have
stooped to the low trick implied in these cut wires!
And yet&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She looked down the half-made road by which Haig
had disappeared. It was quite empty now, save for
Tuesday and herself. Nor was there sight of man or
beast in all the valley. Haig&rsquo;s cattle, like Seth&rsquo;s and
the other ranchmen&rsquo;s, were grazing in the summer
pastures, no doubt in little shut-in valleys far up among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
the pines yonder, where the violet mists were deepening.</p>
<p>She mounted her horse again, and rode slowly up the
hill. But just where the road entered the woods at the
summit of the ridge she stopped once more, and turned
for a last look at her lost valley. Her gaze swept it
lovingly from where, at her left, the long ridge shut off
the view, to where, far at her right, the valley narrowed
into a pine-screened gulch; and back again almost to the
spot where the road dipped and disappeared. There
her eyes were suddenly caught by something she had not
seen before,&ndash;&ndash;a thin spiral of blue smoke that mounted
slowly until it was struck and dissipated by the breeze
from across the ridge. Haig&rsquo;s ranchhouse, surely, nestling
below the hill! The house would be visible,
doubtless, from the place where Haig had vanished from
her sight. What would it be like? she wondered.</p>
<p>The next instant she had pulled her pony half-around
toward the valley. But Tuesday turned his head, and
looked at her; and she felt the blood rushing into her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Tuesday!&rdquo; she cried, jerking him back into
the road. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rode on into the pines, embarrassed beyond all
belief.</p>
<p>In a few minutes she had emerged again from the
woods, descended the hill, and regained the main-traveled
road along the Brightwater. Still she rode
slowly, forgetting that she had learned at last to ride
like a cowboy. She was reluctant to return to Huntington&rsquo;s,
reluctant to relate her experiences as she had
always related them until to-day. Haig had sent a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
warning to Huntington. It was her duty to deliver it.
But how could she tell just so much and no more?
There would be questions. She would be cross-examined,
kindly enough but relentlessly. And in some
strange way this meeting had become a private matter;
Haig&rsquo;s warning was inextricably mixed with other things
that did not concern Huntington. Just what these
were, and why they were so very private, she could not
quite explain to herself; and for the moment she did not
try. They were things to be thought about later, when
she could think more clearly. She knew only that she
should never be able to endure either the banter or the
disapproval of Huntington. What did Claire see in
him anyhow,&ndash;&ndash;the soft and sensitive Claire, with her
blue eyes and her pretty face always upturned so trustfully
to him? For the first time she realized that she
had distrusted Seth from the beginning.</p>
<p>In the midst of these confused and disconcerting
thoughts, she became aware that she was no longer alone
in the highway. Slowly as she rode, she was steadily
overtaking a group of horsemen that appeared to be in
difficulties. At intervals there was a commotion in the
group, and clouds of dust from time to time concealed
it from her sight. She reined up Tuesday, and hesitated,
having had her fill of adventure for one day.
Then, as the men seemed to be quite oblivious to her
presence, and deeply absorbed in their own affair, curiosity
drew her onward; and all her scruples were
forgotten when she had ridden near enough to see the
cause of the disturbance.</p>
<p>Three men on cow ponies were leading, driving, and
avoiding a fourth horse, which was not a cow pony by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
any possible extension of the word. This horse, which
wore neither saddle nor bridle, but only a rope around
his neck, maintained an almost uninterrupted struggle
with his guards. At the first near glimpse she caught
of him through the dust, Marion uttered an exclamation
of surprise and admiration. He was larger than the
ponies ridden by the men, larger than any cow pony,
yet not a big horse measured by any standard with which
she was familiar. His lines were like those of a thoroughbred,
and in his movements, for all his fury, there
was a lightness, a daintiness, an eloquence that suggested
nothing so much as the airy grace of a young girl
skipping and dancing across a playground.</p>
<p>But it was his color especially that drew the cry from
Marion&rsquo;s lips. This was pale yellow, not the cream color
of the familiar buckskin breed, but something golden;
of a brilliant luster like gold leaf, but softer; rather
like cloth-of-gold, with a living, quivering sheen. All
the horse&rsquo;s body was of this uniform, strange tint, but
his mane and tail were a dull, tawny yellow deepening
at the extremities into the hue of rusty gold. Though
his hide was streaked with the sweat of his rebellion,
and caked in places with the dust of the long road he
had come, and welted by the whips of his tormentors,
the color and the gloss shone out as undimmed as his
proud spirit was undaunted by the hard knocks of his
captivity.</p>
<p>The three men clearly were hard pressed. Their
faces were coated thick with dust; their eyes were red-rimmed,
bulging, and bloodshot; their movements were
heavy with fatigue. Scarcely a sound escaped their lips
as they watched for every fresh man&oelig;uver of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
prisoner, and fought doggedly to gain a yard or two
along the road. In the silence and intensity of the
struggle there was something savage, elemental, and
incomparable, heightened by the extraordinary beauty
of the animal and the uncouth appearance of the men.
Between them, the captive and his captors, Marion&rsquo;s
sympathy was about equally divided. At every gallant
sally made by the horse her heart leaped, and she hoped
instinctively that he would go free. But then, the next
instant, she was thrilled by the bold and shrewd counter-play
of the cow-punchers that blocked the horse&rsquo;s
strategy.</p>
<p>Marion had scarcely comprehended all this, and imperfectly,
when a terrifying thing occurred. The
golden horse seemed to have paused and gathered all
his forces for an effort that should make his best
previous performance look like the silly antics of a colt.
Suddenly, and without any warning man&oelig;uver, he
charged the full length of his rope straight at the man
who held it coiled in his hand, with the end looped
around the horn of his saddle. At the final bound, he
reared as if to fall upon the cowboy and mangle him with
his forefeet. But instead of finishing this attack, he
whirled on his hind legs with incredible swiftness; and
before the man could gather up the slack of the rope, or
brace himself for the shock, the wild horse dashed across
the road with all the strength and fury there was in him.</p>
<p>Marion screamed, and closed her eyes. There were
dreadful sounds of falling bodies, of bodies dragged on
the ground, with grunts and groans and smothered
cries. Then silence. When she dared to look she could
see at first only a welter of men and horses half-hidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
by the dust. Near her lay the gold horse with his head
twisted backward by the taut rope, which choked him
until his eyes bulged, and foam dripped from his lips.
The man who had held the lariat lay half under his
fallen pony, whose efforts to rise were checked by the
tightened rope still tied to the saddlebow. The two
other men were on their feet, one clutching the straightened
halter, the second deftly slipping a lariat around
the prisoner&rsquo;s pawing hind legs.</p>
<p>It was all over in a minute. The taut rope was cut
near the saddle of the fallen pony, which then scrambled
to its feet; the leader rose, shook himself, and proceeded
phlegmatically to adjust the turned saddle, and to climb
stiffly into it; the leading-rope was passed to him again,
the second lariat was loosed from the outlaw&rsquo;s feet,
permitting him to rise; the other men remounted; and
the procession moved on again in silence, scarcely a word
having been spoken from the time the horse made his
mad charge for liberty. And now he seemed to have
had enough of the conflict, for he stepped forward
obediently and, Marion fancied, as demurely as a child
that has finished a naughty tantrum.</p>
<p>Then at last there was speech. One of the men had
dropped back a few paces to be in the rear of the
prisoner. He sat heavily in the saddle, leaning forward
as if he would fall on the pony&rsquo;s neck. But his eyes
never left the golden horse, and when he spoke it was
not to the girl, who had ridden close up to his side, but
to himself, in a kind of hoarse and guttural soliloquy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he ain&rsquo;t done. He&rsquo;s foolin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the man said
again and again, as if he had started the words and
could not stop them. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t done. He&rsquo;s foolin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>Marion looked at him curiously. He was the typical
cow-puncher, in blue flannel shirt and leather chaps,
with the inevitable revolver hanging loosely at his hip,
and a long quirt suspended from his right wrist. The
dust on his face was stained with blood that had flowed
from a raw bruise on his temple, and Marion now noticed
that his left arm hung limp at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>The man turned, and stared at her blankly, and she
saw that his face was distorted into a set expression of
pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arm busted,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, as if surprised
by her question; and then renewed his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throwed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you tried to ride him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerked me. Th&rsquo; man ain&rsquo;t born&rsquo;t c&rsquo;n ride &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were leading him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just thought I was,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;He
drug me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning&ndash;&ndash;about seven miles back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;San Luis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is that, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over yander,&rdquo; he answered, nodding toward the
western mountains.</p>
<p>Marion stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t brought him over the mountains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Round by Pinto Pass, an&rsquo; up through the canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a horse like that before,&rdquo; she said,
after a brief silence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anybody else has,&rdquo; he replied, with a note of
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s no cow pony&ndash;&ndash;surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t never heard o&rsquo; Sunnysides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
f&rsquo;m the city. East, maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m from New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s natch&rsquo;ral. Everybody in these parts has
heard o&rsquo; Sunnysides, though it&rsquo;s not many that&rsquo;s seen
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes brightened a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some strange blood in him,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;Nobody knows what it is, but th&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t another one o&rsquo;
that color, nor his devil spirit, in the whole bunch. The
rest of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s just ordinary wild horses runnin&rsquo; up an&rsquo;
down the sandhills of the San Luis. There&rsquo;s people&rsquo;t
say he&rsquo;s a ghost horse. Fact! An&rsquo; they say&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll
never stay caught. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s certain&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s
been caught three times,&ndash;&ndash;not countin&rsquo; the times cow-punchers
an&rsquo; others has thought they&rsquo;d caught him, but
hadn&rsquo;t. The first time he was caught actual he broke
out o&rsquo; the strongest corral in the San Luis&ndash;&ndash;at night&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;
nobody sees hide nor hair of &rsquo;im&ndash;&ndash;not so much as a
flicker o&rsquo; yellow in the moonlight. An&rsquo; back he was,
headin&rsquo; the herd again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nex&rsquo; time Thad Brinker ropes him. Thad&rsquo;s the
topnotch cow-puncher between the Black Hills an&rsquo; the
Rio Grande, an&rsquo; he comes all the way f&rsquo;m Dakoty when
he hears the yarn about Sunnysides. Thad gits fourteen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
men to help him round up the bunch, an&rsquo; then he ropes
the gold feller after a fight that&rsquo;s talked about yit in the
San Luis. He ropes him. An&rsquo; then what does Brinker
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Marion as if he dared her to make as
many guesses as she wished. She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t the only one that&rsquo;d never hit it,&rdquo; he went
on with satisfaction. &ldquo;Thad ropes him, an&rsquo; while they
lay there restin&rsquo;, Sunnysides all tied up so he can&rsquo;t move,
an&rsquo; Brinker rubbin&rsquo; some bumps he&rsquo;d come by in the
fracas, just then the red comes up onto Sangre de
Cristo. Brinker sees it&ndash;&ndash;Ever seen the sunset color
on Sangre de Cristo? No? That&rsquo;s a pity, Miss. Indeed,
that&rsquo;s a pity. But you&rsquo;re f&rsquo;m Noo York, you
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused again, and Marion began to realize the full
degree of her provinciality and ignorance. She was
from New York. What a pity!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the cowboy, as if resolved to do the best
he could in the circumstances, &ldquo;sometimes&ndash;&ndash;maybe
three or four times a year&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s weird. It&rsquo;s religious.
The white peaks turn red as blood&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re
called Sangre de Cristo. It&rsquo;s Spanish for Blood of
Christ. It makes you feel queer-like&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;He paused a
moment thoughtfully, watching the golden horse as it
stepped quietly, lightly, with head high, just ahead of
them. &ldquo;The red comes onto Sangre de Cristo, an&rsquo;
Brinker sees it. He looks at the blood on the peaks, an&rsquo;
then at the gold horse lyin&rsquo; there all torn an&rsquo; dirty, an&rsquo;
this is what Brinker does, an&rsquo; maybe he couldn&rsquo;t help it.
He ups an&rsquo; cuts the ropes, an&rsquo; Sunnysides&rsquo;s off to his
waitin&rsquo; bunch, an&rsquo; they all go snortin&rsquo; down the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>There was a touch of awe in the man&rsquo;s voice, and
Marion felt a little of it too. She looked toward the
serrated barrier of mountains, in the very middle of
which stood old Thunder under his pall of cloud. Beyond
lay San Luis&ndash;&ndash;Sangre de Cristo&ndash;&ndash;and what
romance! Would she ever&ndash;&ndash;Her eyes rested for a
moment on the black pile that now, as always, fascinated
and yet disturbed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she said at length, turning to the cowboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t no red sunset this time,&rdquo; the man
answered, with a grim smile. &ldquo;But we ain&rsquo;t slep&rsquo;
since,&rdquo; he added, with a return of weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You caught him?&rdquo; she asked admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing with him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sold, if we c&rsquo;n find the man&rsquo;t offered a thousand
for him a year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she knew already. Some swift flash of intuition
told her there was but one man in Paradise Park who&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Haig, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip Haig!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;no. That is, I&rsquo;ve heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on her lips,&ndash;&ndash;the explanation that the men
had passed the branch road leading to Haig&rsquo;s ranch,
that they were now riding away from it. But she hesitated.
And why? She did not know then; but an hour
later she would be reproaching herself bitterly for that
moment&rsquo;s indecision. The words were almost spoken,
but something checked them; and before she could make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
up her mind to follow her first natural impulse it was
too late.</p>
<p>The leader of the party turned in his saddle, and
called to the man at Marion&rsquo;s side, who rode quickly
forward and joined his companions. There was a conversation
inaudible to her ears, and while she still
pondered over her inexplicable hesitation the cowboys
and the golden horse, followed by Marion, approached
the group of squat, unpainted houses that bore without
apology the name of Paradise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>SETH HUNTINGTON&rsquo;S OPPORTUNITY</h3>
</div>
<p>It was Thursday, the one day of the week when Paradise
needed no apologist. For on Thursdays the
stage arrived from Tellurium, bringing the mail and,
now and then, a passenger, and always a whiff of the
outside world. No resident of Paradise Park would
willingly have missed the arrival of the stage; and on
this occasion fully two-thirds of the male population,
with nine-tenths of the female, had already assembled.
But the stage was not due for an hour or more. The
women bargained and gossiped in Thompson&rsquo;s store;
the men, most of them, were gathered around a stiff
game of freeze-out in the Square Deal Saloon; and only
the score or more of saddle horses hitched in front of the
store, and the dozen or so of buckboards and road
wagons parked in the rear of it, showed that Paradise
was in its weekly state of mild and patient expectancy.</p>
<p>So the three cow-punchers, the yellow horse, and
Marion rode into Paradise without being seen or heard,
and halted in front of the post-office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hal-lo! Hallo!&rdquo; sang out the leader of the cowboys.
And then, with the petulance of one that is &ldquo;all in&rdquo;:
&ldquo;Is this a dam&rsquo; graveyard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thin man in his shirt sleeves, with a whisky glass
in one hand and a towel in the other, came to the door
of the Square Deal Saloon. His pallid face had the look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
of settled weariness that is characteristic of keepers of
such oases. Slavin had never, within the recollection of
the oldest frequenter of his establishment, betrayed the
slightest interest in anything. If there was a certain
change in his expression as he looked out between narrowed
eyelids into the garish sunlight it was one indicative
of mild resentment at having been disturbed in
his methodic occupation behind the bar. He saw with
neither interest nor anticipation the three strangers,
who ought to have had enough sense to dismount and
walk in if they wanted anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began in a drawling and sarcastic tone,
&ldquo;what&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It probably would have been a cautious and covered
insult to the presumed intelligence of the strangers, if
he had finished the question. But it died away on his
thin lips. His fishy, blue eyes had caught at last the
gleam of Sunnysides, half in eclipse behind the dull-hued
cow ponies. For a few seconds he stared, while
his mouth stood open, and his features slowly responded
to the first emotion he had felt in years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s bobcats!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>The glass slipped from his hand, and fell tinkling in
pieces on the floor as he lunged out into the road.</p>
<p>In the saloon there was a moment of tense silence
as the men there slowly realized that a phenomenon
had occurred. Slavin was excited! The silence was
followed by a hubbub of raised voices and a racket of
overturned chairs and the scrape and thud of boots on
the sanded floor. At that instant a woman in a pink
calico dress, drawn by Slavin&rsquo;s yell, came to the door of
Thompson&rsquo;s, and promptly screeched. The poker game
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
was never finished; Thompson&rsquo;s trade was ruined for the
day; and the strange group in the roadway became the
center of a jostling, uproarious crowd of men and
women, who alternately bombarded the three cow-punchers
with questions and stared at Sunnysides in
silent wonder. But they were careful to maintain a
respectful distance between themselves and the formidable
captive, though he stood motionless amid all the
uproar, like a golden statue of a horse, with his head
raised proudly, his yellow-black eyes flashing defiance
and suspicion, and his lustrous hide gleaming in the sun.</p>
<p>Marion&rsquo;s enjoyment of this exciting scene was tinged
with a vague uneasiness. She had watched the men
come tumbling out of the Square Deal Saloon and the
women swarming from Thompson&rsquo;s store, and had felt
a curious relief at seeing neither Seth nor Claire among
them. Though she could not have given any reason for
her satisfaction, their absence, and Seth&rsquo;s especially,
seemed to her a piece of rare good fortune. Haig&rsquo;s
warning&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Tell him he&rsquo;s a fool to anger me!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;was
still echoing at the back of her brain; her recent act of
incomprehensible errancy still troubled and perplexed
her; and try as she would, she was unable to suppress
the feeling that she had become inextricably entangled
in the feud between Haig and Huntington. She was
not yet ready to face Huntington. Thank Heaven, he
was not there!</p>
<p>But at the very instant of her self-congratulation, and
when she was just turning her attention again to the
hubbub around the golden outlaw, her eye was suddenly
caught, across the heads of the crowd, by a figure that
caused her to stiffen in the saddle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Seth!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>He came striding rapidly from the direction of the
blacksmith&rsquo;s, the most distant of the group of buildings,&ndash;&ndash;a
large and heavy but well-built man, whose black,
short-cropped beard and bushy, overhanging eyebrows
gave him a somewhat truculent expression, which was
heightened by his rough and domineering demeanor.
He was better dressed, or more carefully at least, than
any of the other men. He wore a coat and trousers of
dark-brown corduroy, a light-gray flannel shirt with a
flowing black tie, and a wide-brimmed Stetson hat. His
belt, under the unbuttoned coat, was of elaborately
stamped leather, with a pocket at one side from which a
heavy, gold watch chain was looped to a silver ring, and
with an ornate holster at the other where the black butt
of a revolver was visible as he moved.</p>
<p>He shouldered his way through the crowd in the heedless
manner of most bulky men, who seldom realize how
much space they take that properly belongs to others.
At six feet from the golden horse he halted, and surveyed
him with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunnysides, eh?&rdquo; he said, turning toward the nearest
of the strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&rsquo;s only one,&rdquo; replied the cow-puncher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who caught him this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us three. That&rsquo;s Jim Raley, with the busted arm.
That other is Jud Smith, My name&rsquo;s Larkin. We
belong to the X bar O outfit on Lost Soldier Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second outfit below Forty-Mile,&rdquo; said Huntington,
familiarly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sanders still foreman?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you doing with that horse up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cow-puncher grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ketch your meanin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this.
Sanders chased Sunnysides three seasons, an&rsquo; thought
he&rsquo;d roped him. But all he gits &rsquo;s a cracked leg, an&rsquo;
not a yeller hair of the slippery beast. Then us three
takes on the job&ndash;&ndash;not presumin&rsquo; to be better&rsquo;n Sanders,
but hopin&rsquo; for luck. It comes our way, an&rsquo; there
you are. We offer him to Sanders&ndash;&ndash;for a price,
natch&rsquo;rally&ndash;&ndash;but he says he don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, an&rsquo;
we c&rsquo;n go to hell with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have missed the road. This is Paradise,&rdquo;
said Huntington.</p>
<p>The crowd roared its appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t much in names,&rdquo; observed Larkin testily.</p>
<p>The crowd laughed again, though, of course, less
heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Heaven or Hell,&rdquo; said Huntington, &ldquo;is the
horse for sale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is&ndash;&ndash;if he ain&rsquo;t sold already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re offered a price for him&ndash;&ndash;if it still holds
good. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve come to Paradise&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; no
other reason, believe me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stir in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some price for a bronco,&rdquo; said Huntington,
with an assumed indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is&ndash;&ndash;if you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about a <i>bronco</i>,&rdquo; retorted
the cow-puncher.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>There was a brief silence, in which all eyes were
turned again upon the golden horse, standing motionless
but alert, as if keenly alive to all that passed. The common
ponies around him stamped, and champed their
bits, and moved restlessly in their places, but Sunnysides
remained calm and observant, with all the dignity and
contempt of a captive patrician in a crowd of yokels.</p>
<p>Marion saw admiration and desire growing in Seth&rsquo;s
eyes, and knew that her foreboding had not been without
reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s paying a thousand dollars for him?&rdquo;
asked Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haig&rsquo;s his name, Philip Haig,&rdquo; answered Larkin.
&ldquo;Know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Larkin had been a little nettled by the levity of the
Paradisians he now had his revenge, though much to his
surprise, in the extraordinary effect produced by his
simple announcement. The smiles faded from the faces
assembled around him; significant glances were exchanged;
and there followed a silence so deep that the
murmur of the Brightwater could be heard quite clearly
across the meadows. Then there was a rustling movement
in the crowd, and every face, as if by a common
impulse, or at a given signal, was turned toward Huntington.</p>
<p>Marion was not sure of the feelings of the others, but
there could be no mistake in what she read in Huntington&rsquo;s
black countenance. She was not only frightened,
but surprised and pained. For all his coarseness and
crudity, she had until to-day believed him to be innately
gentle, with only a rough and ungracious exterior. She
had seen him always tender with Claire, whom undoubtedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
he loved with all the best there was in him. But
now she perceived the other side of his character, which
she had indeed divined at first, but which she had firmly,
on account of Claire, refused to acknowledge. An unworthy
passion glowed in his eyes; his features were
distorted by an expression of mingled cunning and hate;
and his head somehow seemed to sink lower between his
shoulders as he leaned slightly forward, studying the
face of the cow-puncher. Then swiftly he took himself
in hand, and masked his passions under an air of careless
badinage that was, for the moment, suited to his
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t just understand,&rdquo; he drawled insinuatingly.
&ldquo;Haig hasn&rsquo;t been away from the Park lately&ndash;&ndash;unless
he&rsquo;s gone an&rsquo; come by night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A snicker or two, and one loud guffaw rewarded him
for this insult to his absent foe. But Marion felt the
color rising to her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a year ago he&rsquo;s seen him, &rsquo;way off, shinin&rsquo; in
the sun,&rdquo; explained Larkin. &ldquo;He stops at the X bar O,
an&rsquo; says he&rsquo;ll give a thousand for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to go on, is it?&rdquo; sneered
Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Larkin uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you think he&rsquo;ll make good, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man&rsquo;s word ain&rsquo;t good he don&rsquo;t stay in this
country long, does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&ndash;&ndash;he won&rsquo;t stay long!&rdquo; replied Huntington,
with a savage laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; queried Larkin pointedly,
leaning across the neck of his pony, and looking keenly
into Huntington&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Huntington, lifting his huge
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; a lot an&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; nothing,&rdquo; retorted
Larkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know more when you try to collect that
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Larkin, gathering up the reins
as if to terminate the interview. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s his place&ndash;&ndash;if
it ain&rsquo;t a secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over beyond that ridge,&rdquo; said Huntington,
pointing toward the west. &ldquo;You go back about
three miles the way you came, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a branch
road&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; snorted the cowboy whose arm hung limp
at his side.</p>
<p>The three men exchanged glances. They were very
weary; they had used almost the last of their powers to
bring the outlaw this far; and they were plainly reluctant
to undertake another tussle with the tireless
animal, now ready, without doubt, to renew his struggle
for liberty.</p>
<p>Huntington watched them narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all in!&rdquo; grumbled Raley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look it,&rdquo; said Huntington. Then he added
lightly: &ldquo;Still, you ought to fetch up at Haig&rsquo;s place
before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion felt disgust and resentment rising in her at
this misrepresentation of the distance to Haig&rsquo;s ranch.
Whatever Haig had done, this was cowardly and unfair.
She looked eagerly at the other men, expecting to hear
some one correct the gross exaggeration. But the faces
were all blank, and no one spoke.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>Something like a groan escaped from the lips of the
injured cowboy. He looked as if he might tumble from
the saddle at any instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we can!&rdquo; said Larkin doggedly. &ldquo;Come,
men! Let&rsquo;s move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good luck!&rdquo; said Huntington carelessly.
And then, as if on second thought: &ldquo;But see here!
You fellows look all right to me, and if Haig&rsquo;s changed
his mind, or hasn&rsquo;t got the cash handy, bring the horse
back here, and I&rsquo;ll talk business with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk business now!&rdquo; Smith blurted out, averting
his eyes from Larkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll give you five hundred for him&ndash;&ndash;if
you don&rsquo;t want to go any farther. He ain&rsquo;t worth it,
but he&rsquo;s a kind of a curiosity, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t talkin&rsquo; business worth a dam&rsquo;!&rdquo; cried
Larkin. &ldquo;Come along, men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his pony&rsquo;s head, and took a fresh grip on
the halter that held the prisoner. Smith moved also,
though slowly, but Raley did not budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I go any further!&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>Smith stopped, and looked uncertainly from Raley to
Larkin, from Larkin to Huntington, who was studying
him craftily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five hundred isn&rsquo;t wind,&rdquo; said Huntington
sneeringly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over there in Thompson&rsquo;s safe, if
you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see Haig first,&rdquo; said Larkin, compressing his
lips, and speaking more to his companions than to
Huntington.</p>
<p>Smith shifted uneasily in his saddle, while Raley
avoided Larkin&rsquo;s eyes, and looked appealingly at Huntington.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
The ranchman, in his turn, took a sidelong
glance, furtive and questioning, at the faces of his
neighbors. The moment was critical, and much more
was involved in the crisis than the possession of the
golden outlaw. For a long time Huntington had assumed
a certain leadership in the Park, but it had not
always been unquestioned. His qualifications for leadership
were not as apparent to all his neighbors as they
were to himself, and there were some who even resented
his pretensions. Nevertheless he had, in a way, succeeded;
and he had been permitted to represent the
entire valley as far as he liked in the war with Philip
Haig. One and all, indeed, regarded Haig as an
intruder; many of them had more than once threatened
violence against him; and there was not among them
one whom Haig, if he had wanted a defender, could
have counted on. Yet, for all that, Huntington was
practically alone in the depth of his hatred and the violence
of his methods. If Haig had no friends in the
Park, he had only a few, perhaps no more than two or
three, inveterate enemies, of whom Huntington was the
active representative.</p>
<p>Huntington now saw in the faces of the men around
him that they were doubtful of him, and that the time
was opportune to turn their passivity into energetic
support of his plans. Moreover, he had already &ldquo;put
his foot in it,&rdquo; had gone too far to withdraw without discredit.
Having openly insulted the absent enemy, and
having clearly revealed his intention to cheat him of this
prize, to weaken now would be to abandon forever all
hope of ascendency. For an instant he regretted what
he had done, and cursed himself under his breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Then, taking a new grip on himself, he returned to the
attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven hundred and fifty, then!&rdquo; he said with a
swagger. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s cash, not words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of suspense. The three men,
who were moving slowly away, turned in their saddles.
Not a muscle quivered, not a foot stirred in the expectant
crowd. Marion felt that in another minute she would
cry out, shrieking at Seth, shrieking the warning Haig
had sent by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough, for me!&rdquo; declared Raley, throwing
the reins over his pony&rsquo;s head, and preparing painfully
to dismount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jim!&rdquo; cried Smith. &ldquo;Let him say a thousand,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m with you. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t exactly on the square, but
the&rsquo;s no use killin&rsquo; ourselves for&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His speech was cut short by a shrill cry from a woman
who stood on a horse block at the outer edge of the
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; she called, pointing a finger toward
the long white road.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE HIGHEST BIDDER</h3>
</div>
<p>Far up the road appeared a little cloud of dust with
a black speck in its center.</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the crowd; a name was passed
from mouth to mouth; and the men nearest Huntington
began to edge away instinctively, leaving a larger and
larger space clear around him and the three cow-punchers.</p>
<p>Marion too looked, and understood. She had not dismounted,
but still sat her pony within ten feet of the
outlaw, at the side of the roadway, in about the middle
of which stood Huntington. With an effort she drew
her eyes away from that ominous black spot in the distance,
and turned toward Seth. A shiver ran through
her body, but her cheeks burned, and there was a voice in
her ears that shouted, &ldquo;Tell him he&rsquo;s a fool to anger
me!&rdquo; For a moment she was on the point of rushing
upon Seth, and shrieking that warning into his face.
But now it was too late.</p>
<p>Like all the others Huntington stood for a few seconds
fascinated by that figure in the puff of dust. And for
just those few seconds there was a certain unsteadiness
in his attitude, irresolution in the black eyes beneath
their bushy brows. But the blue-whiteness under the
dark beard was not the pallor of fear, so called. Seth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
Huntington was as incapable of physical cowardice as
he was of moral courage. He was not afraid of Philip
Haig, but he was dreadfully afraid of being thought
afraid of him. There was yet time to avoid a clash with
Haig, to withdraw from an undertaking in which he
knew he was wholly in the wrong. But he was not equal
to that test of character. He would sooner tackle all the
Haigs in Christendom than face the derision of his
neighbors, whom he had assiduously taught to expect
great things of him on the first occasion. Here was
the occasion; he had seized it, blinded by passion; and
there was no way for him now but to see it through.
He straightened up, and faced the three cow-punchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he cried defiantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the three had heard the name murmured by the
crowd, had seen the distant horseman. Larkin was
plainly elated. Raley and Smith, as plainly abashed,
looked this way and that, avoiding the eyes of their
leader, and every other eye as well. Huntington, seeing
the game about to slip from his hands, whirled on his
heel and looked swiftly toward the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thompson!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; was the answer, as a small, gray-bearded
man in shirt sleeves advanced a step or two from the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch me that roll from your safe, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Thompson disappeared within the store, Huntington
turned again toward the cowboys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;cash!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Larkin leaned forward on his horse, and looked at him
shrewdly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s not the horse you&rsquo;re after so much
as him,&rdquo; he said, with a grin and a nod toward the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; retorted Huntington. &ldquo;Money
talks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it says mighty funny things sometimes,&rdquo; replied
Larkin, who now made no concealment of his dislike
of Huntington and his &ldquo;game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; cried Huntington angrily. &ldquo;How
does twelve hundred sound to you two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked steadily at Raley and Smith, who exchanged
glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your awful hurry?&rdquo; Larkin demanded, in a
drawling tone, but with an anxious eye for the galloping
figure now in plain view. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give Haig a chance
to bid&ndash;&ndash;eh, men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith shot an angry but uneasy look at the leader.
Huntington saw it, and guessed that there was more
than weariness and greed in the willingness of Smith
and Raley to combine against Larkin. Probably, he
thought, there had been differences of opinion, disputes
even, on the road to Paradise. He turned impatiently
toward the store.</p>
<p>At that instant Thompson ran out, broke through the
ring of men, and handed a roll of &ldquo;yellowbacks&rdquo; to
Huntington, who hurriedly peeled off several of the bills,
and thrust them at arm&rsquo;s length toward the wavering
cow-punchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haig talked about a thousand dollars!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s fifteen hundred. Do you want it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment it was heads or tails. Even Larkin
eyed the money hungrily. Then his teeth clicked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
together, and he turned upon his partners, whose
faces showed plainly the answer that was upon their
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;ll you say to <i>him</i>?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen hundred!&rdquo; shouted Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough for me!&rdquo; cried Raley. &ldquo;Say
it, Jud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a distant thunder of hoofs as Haig&rsquo;s
horse took the short bridge over the Brightwater. The
crowd backed still farther away from Huntington, who
was again fingering his roll of bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand!&rdquo; he roared, shaking the handful
of &ldquo;yellowbacks&rdquo; at the wavering Smith.</p>
<p>Raley leaned from his saddle, and grabbed Smith&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Jud!&rdquo; he pleaded hotly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a
fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! We&rsquo;ll take it!&rdquo; answered Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Larkin firmly, pulling his horse around
between Huntington and the two partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the two cried out together.</p>
<p>Huntington stepped forward, and thrust both handfuls
of bills almost into Larkin&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name your price then!&rdquo; he bellowed.</p>
<p>Larkin looked at the money,&ndash;&ndash;smelt it,&ndash;&ndash;as he said
afterwards, grimly confessing his weakness at the sight
of more than he could save in years of riding the range
and branding mavericks. If there had been ten seconds
more&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Haig galloped into the crowd, which gave him plenty
of room, and reined up his pony just in front of the
golden outlaw. For some instants he saw only the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
horse; and his eyes kindled. Then he faced the cowboys
and Huntington.</p>
<p>They were fixed in almost the very attitudes in which
he had come upon them. Huntington&rsquo;s outstretched
hands had indeed fallen to his side, but they still
clutched the crumpled bills. Raley&rsquo;s blood-stained
face was purple with anger and chagrin, while Smith&rsquo;s
wore a sullen, hangdog look. As for Larkin, he met
Haig&rsquo;s questioning scrutiny with a look of mingled triumph
and guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you go on?&rdquo; asked Haig, with a
smile.</p>
<p>There was no response. The silence was again so
complete that the music of the Brightwater was heard
across the meadows.</p>
<p>Haig slowly swept the crowd with an inquiring
glance. All these men were hostile toward him, of
course; but how far would they support Huntington?
No matter! He swung himself suddenly out of the
saddle, and addressed himself to the leader of the cowboys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Larkin, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the embarrassed cow-puncher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the others are Smith and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raley,&rdquo; prompted Larkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here, of course, is my good friend Huntington,
looking like Fortune with both hands full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several men in the crowd laughed, whereupon Huntington,
who had evidently forgotten the money, made
matters worse for himself by hastily and clumsily
thrusting it into the pockets of his coat, while his face
flushed angrily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Cousin Seth,&rdquo; Haig said lightly.
&ldquo;You may need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion, at these words, quivered with alarm. Was
he going to tell Huntington, there in that crowd, of
the incident in the pasture? His next speech, however,
reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Larkin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s understand things.
That&rsquo;s my horse, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been sayin&rsquo; some time back,&rdquo;
answered Larkin, in a tone of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Smith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; was the sullen reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Raley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; answered that one with a sudden
flare-up of courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then whose horse is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belongs to Larkin an&rsquo; Smith an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But why did you bring him to Paradise
Park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raley, caught in the trap, looked appealingly toward
Smith, but got no help from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; repeated Haig sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you&ndash;&ndash;if you wanted him!&rdquo; Raley blurted out
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wanted him!&rdquo; retorted Haig ironically. &ldquo;I
bargained for him with you, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Raley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you went and caught him <i>for me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you brought him to Paradise Park <i>for me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Don&rsquo;t be downhearted!&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
&ldquo;A good name is more to be desired than great
riches. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Cousin Seth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranchman&rsquo;s face flamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got anything to say to me, say it quick!&rdquo;
he jerked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have several things to say to you, one at a time,&rdquo;
replied Haig smoothly. &ldquo;To begin with, these men
told you the horse was mine, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t. They said you&rsquo;d offered a thousand
dollars for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if that suits you better! They told you
they had brought  him here to deliver him to me for a
thousand dollars, and you thought it would be a fine
joke to buy him yourself. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington did not respond to this, but watched
Haig narrowly, a little puzzled by his manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did he offer you?&rdquo; Haig asked Larkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;and then he said name our
price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned if you haven&rsquo;t got some sporting
blood in you!&rdquo; he said, smiling at Huntington.
&ldquo;How much was in your roll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s first impulse was to tell Haig that it
was none of his business. But he was deceived by
Haig&rsquo;s manner, having expected his enemy to fall upon
him like a thunderbolt. His surprise was shared, indeed,
by most of the men, who had expected gun-play
on the jump. Only Marion, sitting still and watchful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
on her pony, was not misled. She felt that Haig was
playing with Huntington, and biding his time.</p>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s vanity completed his self-delusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four thousand, two hundred dollars&rdquo; he replied
boastfully, glancing around at his neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; uttered Haig, between pursed lips.
Then to Larkin: &ldquo;You were hard pressed, weren&rsquo;t
you? But never mind, boys, I&rsquo;ll do better than I promised&ndash;&ndash;and
charge it up to Cousin Seth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another laugh flickered around the crowd. It was
evident that there was no great objection to seeing
Huntington baited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Huntington!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this damned cousin business, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it annoy you?&rdquo; he asked, in a tone of exaggerated
politeness.</p>
<p>Huntington merely glared. He was one of those
self-made wits who enjoy their own jokes immensely
but grumble at plucking barbed shafts out of their own
skins. He began to wish for the thunderbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s your own fault, you know,&rdquo; Haig added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in hell are you talking about?&rdquo; Huntington
growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about your last visit to my ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My last&ndash;&ndash;What do you mean, damn you!&rdquo; the
ranchman thundered, his right hand moving to his belt.</p>
<p>There was a hurried movement among those of the
crowd who, absorbed in the dialogue, had half-consciously
crept nearer. But Haig appeared to have
noticed neither Huntington&rsquo;s motion nor the backing
away of the spectators.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t it have been reckless extravagance
to pay good money for Sunnysides when you might just
have come and taken him out of my corrals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few seconds Huntington, as if he could scarce
believe that he heard aright, was speechless with amazement
and rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it, damn you!&rdquo; he said chokingly. &ldquo;What do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so excited, or you may break a blood vessel,
Cous&ndash;&ndash;I beg your pardon, <i>Mister</i> Huntington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it!&rdquo; roared the ranchman.</p>
<p>Then Haig dropped his mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say it,&rdquo; he began in a voice that rang ominously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it so that even you cannot fail to understand
me. I mean that I&rsquo;m tired of your threats
and persecutions. I mean that you have harassed me
and my men at every opportunity. I mean that you
drove that bunch of my cattle off the cliff last September.
I mean that within twenty-four hours another fence has
been cut, and that you know who did it. I mean that
your attempt to buy my horse was only another of the
contemptible and cowardly tricks you have played on me.
I mean, Huntington, that you are a bully, a liar and a
thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s hand had slipped to the butt of his revolver
at the beginning of this intolerable speech; but
he had waited, as if fascinated, as if unable to move
under the torrent of denunciation. Then to the onlookers
it appeared that the bold young man, who had
not yet made the slightest motion toward his own
weapon, would be slain in his tracks. But Haig was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
as much the quicker in action as he was the nimbler in
wit.</p>
<p>The two revolvers cracked, it seemed, as one, but
with very different results. Haig&rsquo;s battered old hat,
lifted as if by a sudden gust of wind, slid from his
head, and fell to the ground with a bullet hole through
it. But Huntington threw up his hands, pitched forward,
and fell in a heap in the dusty road.</p>
<p>There was a single shrill, short-cut shriek as a
woman near the door of the post-office slipped down
in a faint; and then a chorus of quavering cries as
other women clutched the arms of the men nearest
them.</p>
<p>Marion swayed in her saddle, her head drooping on
her breast. A young cowboy darted from the crowd,
and grabbed her as she fell. He started to lift and
carry her away, but, with a desperate effort, she recovered,
and stood erect, trying to thrust him from
her. He held her nevertheless, supporting her with
an arm under one of hers.</p>
<p>Haig had quickly turned and faced the group of
men at the left of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anybody else here that wants to buy my
horse?&rdquo; he demanded coolly.</p>
<p>There was no response, no movement. He whirled,
and confronted the silent row of men on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anybody else here who thinks he can drive
me out of Paradise Park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no one replied; and Haig, with a shrug, thrust
his revolver back in its holster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thompson!&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; was the answer, in the same tone of readiness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
with which he had responded to Huntington. By
keeping his mouth shut, and never taking sides in any of
the occasional disagreements and disputes that enlivened
the tedium of life in that community, Thompson
had established a reputation for neutrality and trustworthiness,
and was permitted to be everybody&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look after Huntington, please!&rdquo; said Haig.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not badly hit&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll find the bullet under the
left shoulder blade. It&rsquo;ll do him good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thompson and some others lifted Huntington, and
carried him into the store; and at that moment the
stage, its approach unnoticed, rattled up, and stopped
with shrieking brakes and creaking harness. There
was a sudden outbreak of speech on all sides, as if
the tension had been relaxed by the recurrence of
a familiar and orderly event. In the confusion Haig
turned toward Sunnysides and the three cow-punchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Larkin,&rdquo; he began briskly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll finish this
business, and then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short, and stared.</p>
<p>By the side of the golden horse stood Marion. Still
shocked and bewildered, yet strangely thrilled, she had
stretched out one trembling arm, and rested her hand
on the neck of the wild creature, from which every
other person in the crowd around&ndash;&ndash;and she too in
her right senses&ndash;&ndash;had kept away, in full appreciation
of his reputation. Whether it was that the outlaw had
for the time given up all notion of resistance and hostility,
or that he felt the difference between the girl&rsquo;s
gentle touch and the rough handling he had undergone,
he did not stir. But this docility, this understanding,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
was only a part of the sight that brought
Haig to a standstill.</p>
<p>He had left many things behind him, but there was
one thing he had not been, able to destroy as he would
have destroyed it, root and branch and flower. He
would always have a weakness&ndash;&ndash;he called it that&ndash;&ndash;for
beauty in whatever form it appeared to him. Sunsets
and twilights, the shadows of trees in still waters,
flowers and reeds, old ruins in the moonlight, sometimes
even faces moved him until he was ashamed, and
berated himself for a sentimental weakling. And
now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The girl was tawny as a leopard. Her hair was
almost exactly the color of the outlaw&rsquo;s dull yellow
mane, but finer, of course, and softer; and her complexion&ndash;&ndash;he
wondered that he had not noticed it before&ndash;&ndash;had
a peculiar richness and brilliancy that
seemed to reflect the luster of Sunnysides&rsquo; golden hide.
They stood there entrancing his artist-eye with their
perfect harmony of line and color; and the last thin
rays of the setting sun bathed horse and girl in a golden
light&ndash;&ndash;an atmosphere in which they glowed like one
of Titian&rsquo;s mellowed canvases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, please!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>But Marion did not hear, or did not heed. She
dropped her hand, and glided toward him, while he
watched her, curious and rapt. Perhaps it was because
he saw her through that golden glow, perhaps
because his nerves were a little unsteady in the reaction
from the strain they had undergone, that she made a
singular appeal to his imagination. He fancied that
for all the fineness of her figure, the exquisite poise of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
her small head, the cameo-like delicacy of her face,
there was something in her as wild, untamed, and elemental
as the heart of Sunnysides.</p>
<p>Thus she moved slowly past him, and passing gave
him a long and steady look, with an unfathomable expression
in her eyes,&ndash;&ndash;an expression neither of anger
nor of bitterness nor of disgust nor of anything he
might have expected after all he had done that day.
He turned, and watched her until she had disappeared
in the crowd around the stagecoach; and with her went
out the last rays of the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; said Philip Haig.</p>
<p>With a shake of his shoulders, as if to throw off some
unwelcome weight upon them, he turned again to take
up his business with the gaping cow-punchers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;HE SHALL TELL ME!&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>Doctor Wilson, arriving from Tellurium on
the third day after the encounter at Paradise,
found Huntington in a bad way, due not so much to
the wound in his left shoulder as to the state of his
mind. Haig&rsquo;s bullet was extracted without difficulty
or serious complications, but Haig&rsquo;s words were encysted
too deep for any probe. Huntington&rsquo;s self-love
had been dealt a mortal blow; and somebody must pay
for it.</p>
<p>First of all it was Claire that paid; then Marion.
He did not mean to be disagreeable to them, but never
having cultivated self-restraint he had none of it now
to ease the days of his convalescence. He filled the
house with his clamor, and required as much attention
as an ailing child. There were just two ways to keep
him quiet. Claire soothed him when she sat at his bedside,
with one of his huge &ldquo;paws&rdquo; held in her tiny
hands; and Marion found, somewhat to her surprise,
that Seth liked music. The piano was one of the wonders
of the Huntington house, for pianos are not essential
instruments in the equipment of cattle ranches,
and this was the only one in all that region of cattledom.</p>
<p>In music Seth&rsquo;s tastes were sentimental. &ldquo;Lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
Chords&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rosaries&rdquo; subdued him almost to tears;
and if Marion only brought him tuneful violets every
morn he tried his best to be good. So when Claire
was not on duty at the bedside Marion must needs be
on duty at the piano,&ndash;&ndash;an ordeal that Claire endured,
of course, more patiently than Marion.</p>
<p>Claire was almost comically unfit to be a ranchman&rsquo;s
wife, and she too had been a trial on occasions. She
was small and delicate, but vivacious, amiable, bright.
Her blue eyes always had a childlike wonder in them,
and she was fond of wearing her fluffy, golden hair in a
girlish knot low on her neck, or even in a long, thick
braid down her back, with a blue ribbon bow at the
end. She flitted about the house like a butterfly, and
yet she had managed somehow to make her home the
marvel of Paradise Park.</p>
<p>To begin with it was the ordinary, one-story, rambling
house of pine, with spruce-clad hills rising behind
it, and a little stream, rollicking down between it
and the corrals. But a wide veranda had been constructed
on three sides of it, furnished with wicker
chairs, and half-screened with boxes of growing flowers.
All around the house flowers grew,&ndash;&ndash;old-fashioned garden
flowers, roses and geraniums; beds of them everywhere,
and blossoming shrubs along the stream.</p>
<p>The house contained, besides the kitchen and the
bedrooms, just one big room. This, with its low ceiling,
unpainted timbers, and small windows, was not unlike
the hall of some old manor house. The floor was
covered with Navajo rugs in rich and barbaric colors;
the walls were draped with burlap in dull red dyes;
and the windows were curtained with chintz in bright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
yellows and reds. Above the windows and doors hung
many heads of deer and elk and mountain sheep, and
rifles on racks of horn. Between the two front windows
stood the upright piano, and near it a small bookcase
filled with novels and volumes of poetry. The big oak
table at mealtime was made to look very inviting with
white napery and modest china and silver, and a bouquet
always in its center. At other times it was a library
table, heaped with books and magazines, and in
the evening, when the kerosene lamps were lighted, and
the pi&ntilde;on was blazing in the great fireplace, the room
seemed as remote from Paradise Park as Claire herself.</p>
<p>There was an occasional visitor at Huntington&rsquo;s in
the period of his convalescence, usually a ranchwife
eager for another glimpse at Claire&rsquo;s wonderful housekeeping,
or a young cow-puncher drawn by the attraction
of two very pretty and unusual women in one
house. But the ranchmen themselves, with two or
three exceptions, were content to be solicitous at long
range&ndash;&ndash;an abstention that relieved and at the same
time troubled Huntington. He was not eager to talk
with his neighbors about that episode at the post-office,
but their aloofness filled him with uneasiness. Well,
let them wait! They would hear from him again, and
so should Haig!</p>
<p>There was, among the visitors, one whose coming perceptibly
lightened the tedium of those days. Marion
had the good fortune to see him in time not to be taken
by surprise. Seated on the veranda after an exhausting
recital for the benefit of Huntington, she perceived the
figure of a horseman&ndash;&ndash;yes, it was a horseman&ndash;&ndash;riding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
out of the pines toward the corrals. She stared.
He was so little and so lost between his pony, which
seemed extraordinarily big, and his sombrero, which undoubtedly
was enormous, that she remained for a moment
dumb, and then, choking with laughter, fled into
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Claire, look!&rdquo; she cried, grabbing her
cousin&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Claire, dragged to the door, looked and giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen that before?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Never!&rdquo; answered Marion, her hand upon
her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. He&rsquo;s just arrived&ndash;&ndash;for the season.
He was here last year, and the year before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they let him?&rdquo; demanded Marion, thinking
of the irrepressible cow-punchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; Claire assured her. &ldquo;That is,
after you get used to him. The men had all sorts of
fun with him the first summer he was here. But he
took all their fun good-naturedly, and showed them he
had pluck too. They began to like him. Everybody
likes him, and so will you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the name of&ndash;&ndash;who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man had descended like a parachute from
his pony, and was now bobbing rapidly up the graveled
walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smythe,&rdquo; explained Claire hurriedly. &ldquo;But
he&rsquo;s here now&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll let him tell you&ndash;&ndash;he likes to
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the foot of the steps he caught sight of the two
women in the doorway; removed his wonderful headgear
with an eighteenth-century gesture; ducked his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
head in a twentieth-century bow; and smiled. Claire
stepped quickly out on the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Smythe!&rdquo; she cried gaily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad
to see you. Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was an undersized young man, immaculately
dressed in brown tweeds and shining boots, a very high
white collar and a sky-blue tie. The sombrero swinging
in his hand was quite new, ornamented with a broad
band of stamped leather, and it had the widest brim obtainable
at the shop in Denver where a specialty is made
of equipping the tenderfoot for life in the cattle country.</p>
<p>Smythe took Claire&rsquo;s proffered hand, and bent over
it as if he had thought of kissing it, but lacked the courage
of his gallantry. Claire introduced him to Marion,
answered his questions about Seth, and then fluttered
away to the kitchen, where she had an angel cake in the
oven not to be entrusted to the cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived only yesterday, Miss Gaylord,&rdquo; Smythe
chirped. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve heard of you already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to thank you or not,&rdquo; answered
Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you please! What I heard made me very
solicitous about Huntington&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled knowingly at her, and Marion loosed some
of her pent-up laughter. Truly, Smythe was going to
be a treat! She studied him stealthily while he chattered
on. He wore a pointed beard of reddish hue; his
head was quite bald on top, and bulging at the brow;
and the contour of that head, with its polished dome,
and the narrow face tapering down to the pointed beard,
was comically suggestive of a carrot. But it was an intelligent,
even intellectual countenance, and his blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
eyes were honest and bright. He might be laughed at,
but he could not be flouted, she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been here before, Mr. &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began,
and hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smythe,&rdquo; he prompted her generously. &ldquo;J. Hamerton
Smythe. S-m-y-t-h-e. I didn&rsquo;t change it from
Smith, and I don&rsquo;t know what one of my esteemed ancestors
did. But I&rsquo;m glad he did. It gives me a touch
of artificiality, don&rsquo;t you think? I fear being too natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion laughed, and that pleased him. She led the
way to chairs near an open window where a black and
yellow butterfly hovered over a honeysuckle blossom that
had nodded its friendly way into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from New York too,&rdquo; Smythe rattled on.
&ldquo;Columbia. Doing a little tutoring and a little postgraduate
work. This is my third summer in the Park.
Found it by chance. Wanted to go somewhere, and was
tired of the old places&ndash;&ndash;Maine and Adirondacks and
the rest. Looked at a map in a railroad office, and there
it was, sticking right out at me, the first name I lighted
on. In small type too&ndash;&ndash;curious, wasn&rsquo;t it? Clerks in
office hadn&rsquo;t heard of it, but I started out to find it.
Thought I&rsquo;d better get to Paradise when I could. And
now I&rsquo;m glad. I feel like an old settler, and I believe
the cow-punchers have ceased to regard me as a tenderfoot.
That&rsquo;s as flattering as a Ph.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they laugh at me,&rdquo; said Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary. Believe me, these cowboys have
taken to reading poetry since you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please be natural, Mr. Smythe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact! I&rsquo;d hardly got my things unpacked before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
one of them was riding over to ask me if I had a book
about Lady Clara Vere de Vere. It seems he&rsquo;d heard
the poem recited somewhere. I asked him why he
wanted it, but he looked so flustered that I let him off.
Didn&rsquo;t have a Tennyson with me, unfortunately, but I
gave him my Byron, and I think that will hold him for
a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; exclaimed Marion. &ldquo;But what has
all that to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the chap that grabbed you in his arms when
you were falling from your horse after that little business
at Thompson&rsquo;s the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion blushed, and then laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you come to hear about that?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p>He chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hear everything!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;My friends
say I&rsquo;ve a nose for news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall be very careful what I say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, no!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a safety vault
when it comes to secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced quickly toward the door of Seth&rsquo;s bedroom,
then toward the kitchen, before she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve heard all about that day at the post-office?&rdquo;
she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not unexpected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, lowering his voice, and leaning
nearer to Marion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Huntington was looking
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;he deserved it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that. You see&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m neutral, like
Thompson. I like Huntington, and I like Haig. I
look at this fight without prejudice, even though I&rsquo;ve a
reason to be prejudiced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In favor of&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huntington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huntington accepts my friendship, after a fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion stared at him, wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact!&rdquo; he assured her, with a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;d like to, but he lives like a hermit.
Latchstring never hangs outside his door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a certain evidence of feeling in Smythe&rsquo;s
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I knew!&rdquo; He took the words out of her
mouth. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kicked out!&rdquo; he replied with a grimace.</p>
<p>Marion laughed in spite of her burning eagerness to
hear more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly kicked,&rdquo; Smythe explained. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d
rather have been. He was as polite as&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s a gentleman,
you see, so he knew how to do it without using his
hands or his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; insisted Marion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I try? Curiosity. Simple, elemental,
irresponsible curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again at his frank confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean why did he kick you out, as you call
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know. And I will know, too.
I tell you, Miss Gaylord, I admire the man immensely.
His secretiveness only makes me like him the more,
probably because I myself am so garrulous. Most persons,
though, cannot tolerate a man who minds his own
business. Those who have no reason to hate Haig dislike
him because he does not ask them to like him. His
affairs are his own. Did you notice that scar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Marion, scarcely above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can build any sort of romance you like
around that. He has had his romance or tragedy or
something, you may be sure. But he&rsquo;s no ordinary man,
whatever he may be doing in Paradise Park. I have
heard that he&rsquo;s surrounded with books and pictures in
his cottage. He&rsquo;s got a Chinaman for a valet, and an
Indian for his man Friday, and their mouths are as
tight as his. What&rsquo;s more, he must be all right in the
main things, for his foreman and cowboys stick to him
through thick and thin, and say nothing. I tell you,
Miss Gaylord, I&rsquo;d like to be a friend of his, if only he
gave a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A damn, I believe they say,&rdquo; she prompted demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said with enthusiasm. &ldquo;You are
a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held up a warning finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be friends, you know,&rdquo; she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
&ldquo;And friends understand each other&ndash;&ndash;without words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; he agreed, reaching for her hand, and
shaking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this mystery,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anybody
know&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as much as all of us. Of course,&rdquo; he
added banteringly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no denying a woman, when
she starts. He might tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech startled her, and she blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s sheer impudence!&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>But he continued to look at her with a curious expression.
How much had he guessed? In her confusion
an impulse seized her. She leaned suddenly
toward him, with flushed face and sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare me?&rdquo; she demanded, her voice quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare you!&rdquo; he answered gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, he shall tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be around to
take the kicks if he&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cousin Seth!&rdquo; cried Marion, leaping to her
feet.</p>
<p>The bedroom door had opened, and Huntington came
out, dressed in his familiar corduroy suit, but with his
left arm still bandaged to his side, Smythe hastened
forward to greet him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE STORY OF THE SCAR</h3>
</div>
<p>She was awakened by the shrill chatter of the magpies
in the tall pine near her window. Often she
had resented their quarrelsome dialogue at dawn, but
now she slipped eagerly out of bed, and hurried to the
window. There had been rain in the night, but when
she had pulled apart the chintz curtains and opened the
wooden shutters the air was sweet and clean in her face,
and the thin light showed the world rising joyously to
the day.</p>
<p>She dressed hastily in her oldest clothes, stole on tiptoe
to the kitchen for a biscuit and a glass of milk,
found fishing tackle on the veranda, and was soon
running breathlessly past the corrals toward the banks
of the Brightwater. And all this was a deliberate
deception. She purposed to fish, of course&ndash;&ndash;a little,
to justify the clandestine expedition; but what she
really sought was solitude.</p>
<p>It was half in jest that she had said to Smythe, &ldquo;He
shall tell me!&rdquo; But in the night, by some strange
alchemy, that jest had been transmuted into a purpose
of which she was still doubtful, if not afraid. And yet
to go forward seemed less difficult than to go back. For
she had let the days of Seth&rsquo;s recovery and convalescence
slip by without telling Claire of her experience in the
Forbidden Pasture and on the road to Paradise. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
duel at the post-office, she argued, surely had made it
unnecessary to warn Huntington of Haig&rsquo;s anger. And
yet, as their guest, as Claire&rsquo;s cousin&ndash;&ndash;But had they
been quite fair to her? They had not warned her of the
hostility across the Ridge; they had let her go blundering
into the Forbidden Pasture; not that it mattered so
much, though it might have been worse&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Her thoughts were becoming very much confused.
She had permitted a man to treat her most offensively,
and she had seen him shoot down another without compunction;
and that other was her cousin, in whose house
she was a guest. And yet she felt no resentment, no
detestation, no censure, no rebuke. Instead, here she
was running away to think out a plan whereby she might
hear the whole story of the feud, and more, from Haig
himself.</p>
<p>The morning advanced in rose and pearl nuances. A
hundred tantalizing perfumes filled the air; field-spiders&rsquo;
webs sparkled in the dew like silver gossamer; meadow
larks rose at her feet, and wove delicate patterns in the
air with threads of melody. Who could think amid
such diverting beauty? She lifted her head, and went
singing through the meadows, knee-deep in the wet and
clinging grass, and laughing when the parted branches
of the willows splashed her face and drenched her.
And then, at the first cast she made into a still, deep
pool, where the night loitered under the very eye of day,
an imprudent trout took the gray hackle fly, and made
off with it. The splash, and the &ldquo;zip&rdquo; of the tightening
line through the water; and then the fight, and the
capture&ndash;&ndash;Well, if they were going to rise like that&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The sun was high before she became aware that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
was very hot and tired and hungry. Her shoes were
soaking wet, her skirts and stockings splashed with mud;
one shoulder was being sunburned where a twig had
caught and ripped her white flannel waist; and Seth&rsquo;s
red silk handkerchief around her neck was scarcely a
deeper crimson than her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t catch them all in one day!&rdquo; she exclaimed
reluctantly, leaning wearily against a tree.</p>
<p>At that instant, under her very eyes, a trout leaped
in the nearby pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impudence!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just get you, and
then quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was one pool too many; for at the second cast
her hook caught in the rough bark of a log that projected
far out into the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Now I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; she groaned.</p>
<p>Several smart tugs at the line, with a whipping of the
rod to right and left of the log, convinced her that the
hook was too deeply embedded to be released by any such
operation. Sinking down on a heap of driftwood on
the bank, she gloomily contemplated the consequences
of her greed. There were two ways to go about it now,&ndash;&ndash;to
break the line and leave the hook to its fate, or to
crawl out on the log and rescue it. The first was
unsportsmanlike, the second was very likely to be dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m!&rdquo; she muttered, with a grimace. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The log ran out, at a slight inclination upward, from
the center of the heap of driftwood, and its free end,
where the hackle fly reposed at a distance of fully twenty
feet from the bank, was suspended barely two feet above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
the middle of the pool. She leaned forward, and gazed
into its dark depths, which appeared to be scarcely
stirred by the current, though five yards away the stream
was making a merry racket over the shallows.</p>
<p>She stood up, and looked around her. Through the
screen of willows and cottonwoods on each sloping bank
she saw the meadows lying green and silent in the sun.
There was no sound except the prattle of the Brightwater
and the murmur of the breeze in the foliage.
She assured herself that she was quite alone.</p>
<p>Next she folded and pinned up her skirt so that it
hung just to her knees, and after a final glance in all
directions, stepped cautiously out to the edge of the
driftwood, knelt down on the fallen trunk, and began to
creep warily out toward the embedded hook. The log
was round, and none too large; her knees, protected only
by thin stockings, were bruised by the rough and partly-loosened
bark; and she scarcely dared to breathe lest she
should lose her balance, and tumble into the yawning
pool. Once she incautiously looked down, and saw her
image waving dizzily on the slow-moving surface of the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped, as she drew back her gaze, and
dug her nails into the log.</p>
<p>But for all her fears, and because of them, it was
tremendously exciting, and she became deeply absorbed
in her task. Now clinging close to the log in sudden
panic, now laughing tremulously at her trepidation, she
forgot everything except her goal, and the inches by
which she was approaching it. She had arrived within
two feet of the hook, and was just about to reach a
trembling hand to detach it, when she received a shock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
that was near to ending her expedition in an ignominious
splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; called out a voice, somewhere behind her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fright first nearly caused her to lose her grip on
the log, and then left her cold and shivering. After
that a wave of heat swept over her, and the blood tingled
in her flushed and perspiring face.</p>
<p>Who was it? Philip Haig, by all the ill luck in the
world? Who else could have had the effrontery? She
dared not turn to look, both in fear of falling, and in
shame at being caught in that absurd predicament.
What a sight! she thought. Her skirt was above her
knees, and one stocking, caught by a projection of bark,
had slipped down to her ankle. And that was not all!...
With a desperate effort, she lifted one hand from
its hold on the log, and tried to adjust her skirt; but the
movement only unbalanced her. With a shriek she
flattened herself, and lay there panting and miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; the voice cried, more sharply than before.
&ldquo;No move&ndash;&ndash;for minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was arrested by the words. &ldquo;No move for
minute!&rdquo; It was not the voice of Philip Haig, but in
that assurance there was only a doubtful consolation.
If not Haig&ndash;&ndash;who? There was something oddly foreign
in that heavy, harsh, and yet not displeasing voice.
A new fear presently mingled with the others. It was
a wild country after all; and she had taken no note of
the distance she had come, and little of her surroundings.
But she could only obey, and wait.</p>
<p>There came the sound of quick splashing in the water,
and a few seconds later a man&rsquo;s head and shoulders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
appeared in the stream at her side. At sight of the
strange, dark countenance suddenly upturned to her,
within a foot of her own, she almost fainted. It was
a face she had never seen before, solemn, stolid, with a
copper-colored skin, high cheek bones, and deep-set, black
eyes in which there was no more expression than there
was on the thin, straight lips. She closed her eyes.</p>
<p>But that was only for an instant, since nothing terrible
was happening. When she dared to look again the man
was quietly releasing the offending fly. He tossed it
back in the direction of the bank, then stood for a
moment regarding her, still without the trace of an expression
on his dark face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be &rsquo;fraid!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hold still!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed him, though his next move was one to have
brought a scream to her lips if she had not become
incapable of utterance. Standing in the water, which
came almost up to his armpits, he had kept his arms
high above the surface of the pool. Now he stretched
them out toward her, clasped both her ankles with one
huge hand, slipped the other under her waist, and with
what seemed incredible strength and assurance, lifted
her off the log. Then, without so much as wetting the
edge of her skirt, he bore her to the bank, and seated her
gently on the heap of driftwood from which she had
ventured so bravely only a little while before.</p>
<p>Should she weep, or laugh, or rage at him? Through
eyes half-blinded by tears, she searched his face; but he
met her troubled and fiery gaze with the most perfect
calm. Then, after a moment, he deliberately turned,
and stood facing squarely away from her,&ndash;&ndash;an act of
stoicism that at once removed her fears and completed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
her discomfiture. She took the hint implied in his
movement, and bent down, blushing furiously, to pull
up the fallen stocking, and let down her skirt.</p>
<p>When she sat erect again the man had not changed
his position; and she seized the opportunity to study
him. His figure, though she had just had proof of his
strength, was lean almost to thinness, very straight, and
borne, she fancied, with a certain dignity and even
majesty in its erectness. The straight, black hair under
the sombrero was touched with gray. He was not
young, past middle age perhaps; but she could hazard
no nearer guess at his age. No matter! Looking at
him thus, she began to feel her resentment falling away,
as if every shaft from her angry eyes had broken harmlessly
on that serene and unoffending back. Even her
embarrassment began to seem inexcusable. The man
had carried her ashore in much the manner he would
have used if she had been a sack of oats to be saved from
wetting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very strong!&rdquo; Marion said at last.</p>
<p>He turned slowly toward her. His face was grave
and expressionless, but by no means dull; and his eyes
were very black and bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;are&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;right&ndash;&ndash;now?&rdquo; he asked, ignoring
her praise.</p>
<p>There was a curious slowness and lack of emphasis
in his speech, with a pause after each word, that gave a
singular impressiveness to all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you do it?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid you fall,&rdquo; was his simple answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind getting wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy drown in little water,&rdquo; he said laconically.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>She laughed at the idea of her drowning in a pool like
that&ndash;&ndash;she who had battled triumphantly with the
breakers at Atlantic City, Newport, and Bar Harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can swim!&rdquo; she assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not know that,&rdquo; he replied, unmoved.</p>
<p>True. And she must have appeared to be greatly in
need of assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I thank you!&rdquo; she said sincerely. &ldquo;But
who am I thanking, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete! Pete who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Pete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you no other name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Indian name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he rolled out a string of guttural syllables that
sounded like names of places in the Maine woods.</p>
<p>Indian name! Marion started; and in a flash she
knew. Haig&rsquo;s man Friday! Here was luck indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Mr. Haig&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he said, completing her sentence.</p>
<p>Marion was again embarrassed. She did not know
what to say next, fearing to say the wrong thing, and
so to throw away a golden opportunity. In her search
for the right lead, her eyes lighted on a fishing basket
that lay on the ground not far from her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s strange I didn&rsquo;t hear or
see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indian not make noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; she retorted, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trout very smart,&rdquo; he added quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught fourteen,&rdquo; she volunteered eagerly.
&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>For answer he fetched his creel, and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, in envy and admiration, seeing that
the creel was almost full, and that not a fish in sight was
as small as her largest prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you some,&rdquo; he said, glancing at her own
basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she protested quickly. &ldquo;I have
plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She showed him her catch, which was by no means
insignificant. Nevertheless Pete took three of his largest
trout, and transferred them to her basket, ignoring
her protests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are for&ndash;&ndash;him, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biggest you no see. At bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That satisfied her, and she watched him silently while
he found her rod, and reeled in the offending fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brown fly better now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ought see
what trout eating before you try catch big ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this he drew a book of flies from his pocket, and
replaced the gray hackle with a brown one. She questioned
him eagerly, following this plain lead; and
presently they were seated on the pile of driftwood,
while he told her about the native trout and the rainbow
and the California, of little brooks far up among the
mountains where the trout were small but of a delicious
flavor, of the time for flies and the time for worms, of
famous catches he had made, of the way the Indians
fished before the white man showed them patent rods
and reels. By slow degrees Pete&rsquo;s iron features softened,
and he smiled at her, not with his lips, but with
his eyes, which were the blackest, surely, in the world.</p>
<p>But Marion was not diverted from the questions that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
were next her heart. With all her woman&rsquo;s cunning of
indirection, she brought the talk around to Philip Haig.
Did he fish? Sometimes. Did he hunt? Much, when
the deer came down from the heights with the first snows.
Then&ndash;&ndash;she could resist no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been terrible&ndash;&ndash;the accident,&rdquo; she
said, placing a finger on her cheek.</p>
<p>He looked at her strangely, while she held her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That no accident,&rdquo; he said at last, after what seemed
to her an interminable interval of suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No accident?&rdquo; she repeated, trying not to appear
too eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He call it accident, maybe. He say it is nothing.
Pete say it is much. It is big debt. Some day Pete
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was deep silence for a moment. The stream
gurgled and splashed; the breeze whispered through the
cottonwoods; and over all, or under all, was the vague,
insistent, seductive sound that the summer makes in the
fulness of its power.</p>
<p>Marion hesitated, quivering with eagerness and uncertainty.
She was afraid to ask more, lest she should
be shortly rebuffed, and lose her opportunity. But Pete
was looking at her steadily. She felt a flush coming
into her face again. Had he guessed&ndash;&ndash;something&ndash;&ndash;already
in her manner, in her impulsive questions?
More likely it was the charm that, for once unconsciously,
she wielded&ndash;&ndash;the elusive charm of woman that
makes men want to tell, without the asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like to hear?&rdquo; Pete said; and her heart leaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she was keenly disappointed. She had expected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
something romantic, something ennobling and fine.
And it was only a barroom brawl, though Philip was
not in it until the end, to be sure! Five Mexican sheep
herders against the lone Indian. Guns and knives in
the reeking border saloon; and afterwards in the street;
and the Indian almost done for, bleeding from a dozen
wounds; and then a voice ringing out above the fracas:
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m damned if you do! Five to one, and greasers
at that!&rdquo; And Philip Haig had jumped from his
horse, and plunged into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, disdaining to draw his
gun on greasers. Smash! Bang! went his fists, front
and right and left.</p>
<p>Pete had accounted for one Mexican, who would herd
sheep no more on the plains of Conejos. The others
fled. Then Haig, despite the knife-wound in his face,
grabbed the Indian, and somehow lifted him up behind
him on his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Indian!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This town&rsquo;s full of
greasers. You&rsquo;ve got no chance here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the long ride to Del Norte, with the Indian
drooping on Haig&rsquo;s back; and a doctor of Haig&rsquo;s acquaintance,
who sheltered and cured the silent savage.
And Pete, convalescent, had come straight to Haig&rsquo;s
ranch, and remained there, despite Haig&rsquo;s protests that
he did not need another hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete stay until big debt is paid,&rdquo; said the Indian
solemnly. And then, with a straight look into Marion&rsquo;s
eyes, &ldquo;You ought tell Huntington he is damn fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion started. There it was again&ndash;&ndash;the warning!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haig is brave man. Brave man always good man.
So&ndash;&ndash;Huntington got no chance.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE WAY OF A MAID WITH A MAN</h3>
</div>
<p>She rode casually down the Brightwater, and casually
up the Brightwater; she loitered at crossroads,
and tarried at Thompson&rsquo;s store; and not one glimpse
did she catch of Philip Haig. Then one morning she
rose at dawn, as she had risen on the day of her fishing
exploit, with a purpose. But this time she dressed with
exceeding care, in a riding suit she had not yet worn in
the Park. It was soft dove-gray in color, with a long
coat that showed the fine lines of her figure and, when
she rode, revealed snug-fitting breeches above the tops of
the polished boots,&ndash;&ndash;a very different costume from the
black divided skirts and the short jacket in which she
had galloped about the Park.</p>
<p>Thus arrayed and resolute, she rode straight down the
valley to the branch road that had once tempted her to
adventure; straight up the hill; and straight through
the woods until she halted once more in the shade of the
outpost pine that stood beyond its clustered fellows like
a sentinel above the valley. Her valley! She waited a
moment, wondering if it welcomed her. There was the
stream, still flashing in the sun, the meadows as brightly
green as then, the grass of the pasture running in bronze
waves before the breeze. From the heart of a wild rose
a gorgeous red and brown butterfly flew out and fluttered
over her head. Not a dozen yards below her a meadow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
lark, unseen, burst into sudden, thrilling song; and
somewhere down the hill another took up the strain, then
another and another, until the air was charged and
quivering with melody, piercing sweet. She listened,
her heart throbbing to the music, until the chorus died
away in dripping cadences, and only a drowsy murmur
came from the ripening fields to mingle with the low
droning of the pine organ on the hill. Yes! Her valley
welcomed her.</p>
<p>She rode on down the hill, with only a quick and
embarrassed glance into the Forbidden Pasture; and
suddenly raised herself excitedly in the stirrups. There
again was the spiral of blue smoke; then a chimney and
a red roof; and finally the house itself, and barn and
corrals, all tucked away against the foot of the hill.
Dismounting, she led Tuesday back a few yards, and
left him to feed along the roadside. Then she returned,
and seated herself on a rock, half-hidden by a blackberry
bush, to study the group of houses lying low and silent
in the sun.</p>
<p>There were more buildings than at Huntington&rsquo;s, but
she saw no beds of flowers, no wide veranda screened
with potted plants; a certain bareness and air of inhospitality,
she thought. No tea and angel cake for visitors!
Behind the ranch house were two cottages of
unpainted pine, scorched to a yellow-brown by many a
summer sun. One of them, doubtless, was the hermit&rsquo;s
lodge. The barn, larger than Seth&rsquo;s, had a red roof,
newly painted. And in one of the corrals&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;the
flash of a golden hide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunnysides!&rdquo; murmured Marion.</p>
<p>Then her heart stood still. She had descried the figure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
of a man seated with his back against the bars of this
corral. But it was not Philip Haig; Sunnysides&rsquo; guard,
no doubt, for he never left his post until relieved by
another an hour or so later, when the dinner bell had
been rung at the door of the ranch house.</p>
<p>She had scarcely time to feel her disappointment
before a man emerged from the stable leading a saddle
horse. Another immediately followed, and this time
there was no mistake. The second man was Philip
Haig. He mounted quickly, and started off; then
stopped to address a word or two, apparently, to the
man at the stable door; and finally galloped past the
ranch house and the cottages, and up the slope behind
them toward the pines, across the valley from where she
sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Marion, in a tone of vexation and reproach.</p>
<p>She watched him until he had disappeared among the
trees; and tears started in her eyes. Would he always
be riding away from her, behind the hills, the woods, a
turn of the road? She sat a while in deep dejection;
but not for long. Her spirit was too resilient for futile
moping, and her purpose too firmly held to be abandoned
on one reverse. She reflected that if he had gone he
must as certainly return; and so, with a toss of her head,
she presently arose, and fetched her raincoat and her
luncheon from the saddle. The coat she spread out on
the ground, seated herself on it with her back against
the rock, and settled down to eat, and watch, and wait.</p>
<p>Morning mounted hot and humming into noon, and
noon dropped languidly into afternoon. The blazing
sun centered his rays upon her; insects found and pestered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
her; discomfort cramped her limbs, and weariness
weighted down her eyelids. Twice she dozed, and wakened
with a start of fear lest she had slept her chance
away. But each time she was reassured by a hurried
survey of the group of buildings, where no one stirred,
and there was no sign of Philip Haig. So the hours
dragged their slow length along.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon before her vigil was
rewarded. Not from just the direction in which he had
galloped away, but from farther up the valley, Haig
reappeared. He rode as rapidly as before, straight to
the door of the stable, reined up a moment there, and
was off again,&ndash;&ndash;this time down the valley on a white
road that was visible to Marion until it curved behind
the distant point of the ridge on which she sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where&rsquo;s he going?&rdquo; she murmured, wrinkling
her forehead as she saw him once more vanish from her
sight.</p>
<p>She did not know that road, but guessed that it
joined the main highway somewhere far down the
Brightwater. No matter! Here was her opportunity;
for she saw, with quick appreciation, that she would
now be able to place herself between him and the ranch
buildings without showing herself to the men at the
corrals. And then? She could not &ldquo;hold him up&rdquo;
like a highwayman; and if she did not stop him he
would raise his hat (perhaps), and ride past her without
a word. And how was she to stop him? She had come
there with a very definite purpose, but with no clear
plan, trusting to the inspiration of the moment. And
now the moment had arrived; but where was the inspiration?
She had risen impulsively to her feet, and stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
staring between narrowed eyelids, and beneath a puckered
brow, at the white road, now quite empty again.
Then suddenly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>And thereupon she blushed, and looked furtively
around her, as if she had been caught in some doubtful,
if not discreditable, act. But there was no time for
moral subtleties. She staggered&ndash;&ndash;for her legs were
stiff from inaction&ndash;&ndash;to her pony, replaced her raincoat
behind the saddle, mounted in hot haste, and rode down
the steep hill toward the houses. At a little distance
from them the road she traveled joined the other.
There she turned abruptly, and followed the unfamiliar
road until she was safely out of sight of any chance
observer at the barn, and yet not so far from the trail
she had just left but that she could return to it if, by
any chance, he should come back that way.</p>
<p>Dismounting quickly at the chosen spot, she turned
Tuesday until he stood squarely across the road. Then
her nimble fingers flew at the cinches of the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now!&rdquo; she exclaimed, hot with excitement
and exertion.</p>
<p>She stepped back to view her handiwork, and laughed
nervously. Next she drew a tiny mirror and a bit of
chamois skin from her bosom, and swiftly removed some
of the dust and moisture from her flushed face. Then
her hair, always somewhat unruly, required a touch or
two. That done, she smoothed down the gray coat over
her slender hips, adjusted the gray silk tie at her throat,
and waited.</p>
<p>He came, in his habitual cloud of dust; pulled up his
pony within ten feet of the obstruction; saw the saddle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
hanging at a dangerous angle over Tuesday&rsquo;s side; and
accepted the obvious conclusion that Miss Marion Gaylord,
looking very warm and embarrassed, but certainly
very pretty in her confusion, had narrowly escaped a
fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better help you with that, Miss Gaylord,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; she said, with an appealing reluctance.
&ldquo;I can do it&ndash;&ndash;I often saddle my own horse,
and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should judge that you had saddled him this time,&rdquo;
he interrupted her to say, without the slightest trace of
irony in his tone.</p>
<p>She bit her lip, as she silently made way for him, and
stood at Tuesday&rsquo;s head, stroking his neck with one
small, gloved hand while Haig adjusted the blanket,
fitted the saddle firmly, and tightened the double cinch.
He was dressed in the nondescript costume he had worn
at their first meeting. That same hat, uniquely insolent,
soiled and limp and disreputable, was stuck on the
back of his head, revealing a full, clean-moulded brow,
over which, at one side, his thick black hair fell carelessly.
His eyes were calm gray rather than stormy
black to-day, but a gray that was singularly dark and
deep and luminous. His manner was in the strangest
contrast with the two different moods in which she had
already seen him&ndash;&ndash;as if the fires were out, as if all
emotion and interest had been dissolved in listlessness.
And she divined at once that her chance of success was
small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will hold, I think,&rdquo; he said gravely; and
started toward his horse.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Tuesday&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; she said eagerly.</p>
<p>Haig paused, on one foot as it were, and looked over
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fortunate for you that he&rsquo;s been well gentled,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You should look to your cinches rather often
when you ride these hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;You should keep your feet dry, and come in when
it rains,&rdquo; he might as well have said, she thought angrily.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was careless of me,&rdquo; she answered, trying to
say it brightly, but really wanting to shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happens to everybody once in a while,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>On that, he stepped to his pony, put a foot in the
stirrup, and one hand on the saddle horn, and paused.</p>
<p>She could easily have flopped down in the road, and
wept. Once he had raged at her, once he had thrilled
her with a look, and now he was simply dismissing her,&ndash;&ndash;leaving
her, as her father would have put it, &ldquo;to
stew in her own juice.&rdquo; She saw all her elaborate
strategy, her long vigil on the hill, her struggle with the
saddle, her appealing&rsquo; glances&ndash;&ndash;all, all about to go for
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might at least help me on my horse!&rdquo; she
thought, in bitter resentment.</p>
<p>Perhaps tears blinded her. At any rate&ndash;&ndash;and this
was without pretence, and no part of her scheme&ndash;&ndash;she
did not see clearly what she was doing. It was nothing
new to mount her pony from the level; she had done it a
hundred times without mishap. But now, in her agitation,
she stood somewhat too far away from Tuesday&rsquo;s
shoulder; and the pony, as ponies will sometimes do,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
started forward the instant he felt the weight in the
stirrup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; cried Haig.</p>
<p>It was too late. She missed the saddle; her right foot
struck Tuesday&rsquo;s back, and slipped off; and she fell
sprawling on the ground, with her left foot fast in the
stirrup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, Tuesday!&rdquo; she cried shrilly as she fell.</p>
<p>Luckily the horse did not take alarm and run, as a less
reliable animal might have done, dragging the girl
under his heels. He stopped in his tracks, and stood
obediently, even turning his head as if to see what
damage had been done. It was enough. Marion was
uninjured, but badly frightened; and her humiliation
was complete. She lay on her back, struggling vainly
to extricate her foot from the stirrup. Her coat skirts
had fallen back, and&ndash;&ndash;Thank Heaven for the riding
breeches, and not what she had worn under divided
skirts!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie still!&rdquo; yelled Haig, remembering what he had
seen happen to men in such circumstances.</p>
<p>In three leaps he was at her side. With a swift
movement (and none too gentle), he wrenched her foot
loose from the stirrup, and helped her to sit up, dazed
and trembling and very white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ankle&ndash;&ndash;is it hurt?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>And then the expected &ldquo;inspiration of the moment&rdquo;
came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>And so it was done. Her foot had indeed been
twisted slightly; she had truly, <i>truly</i> felt a twinge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
pain. At another time she would have thought no
more about it, but now&ndash;&ndash;The color rushed back into
her cheeks; she fetched a smile that was half a grimace;
and the game was on again.</p>
<p>Haig reached a hand to her. She took it, and let
him draw her to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the ankle&ndash;&ndash;just a step!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>She rested her weight on her left foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried out, and looked helplessly at Haig.</p>
<p>A shadow, unmistakably of annoyance, passed over
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to faint, are you?&rdquo; he asked, looking
keenly at her.</p>
<p>Her color always came and went easily, and now, a
little frightened by her bold deception, she was pale
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;I think not,&rdquo; she said. (&ldquo;At any rate not
here,&rdquo; she might have added.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you ride to the corrals?&rdquo; was his next question.</p>
<p>The look of annoyance was now fixed on his face, but
it did not discourage her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked doubtfully at Tuesday. Thereupon,
without a word, Haig led the horse close to her, but
placed so that she was at Tuesday&rsquo;s right side instead of
the left. Then, while she supported herself with one
hand on his shoulder, he raised her right foot, and thrust
it into the stirrup; and, with a hand under each of her
arms, lifted her until she was able to throw the left foot
over, and her body into the saddle. Once more Marion
bit her lip. His action was as devoid of personal interest
as Pete&rsquo;s had been when he carried her out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
pool; and she had not come to Philip Haig to be treated
like a sack of oats!</p>
<p>Haig mounted his pony, and rode up close beside her;
and thus, in unbroken silence, they arrived at the door
of the stable. There Haig dismounted quickly, stepped
briskly around her horse, and almost before she was
aware of his intention, lifted her out of the saddle, and
set her on her feet&ndash;&ndash;all very carefully and gently, but
also very scrupulously, without an unnecessary pressure,
without even a glance into her waiting eyes. What was
the man made of? Why would he not look at her?
Why did he not rage at her&ndash;&ndash;if he could do nothing
better? Well, the cat had at least seven lives
left!</p>
<p>She almost forgot to limp, but bethought herself in
time, and gasped as he led her to an empty soap box at
the side of the stable door. Having seated her there,
he called out to the man on guard at Sunnysides&rsquo; corral:
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Curly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down by the crick,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him here! I&rsquo;ll watch the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he took the man&rsquo;s place, and stood with
his arms crossed on the top rail of the fence, his eyes
fixed on the golden horse. And Marion felt a real pain
at last,&ndash;&ndash;a pang of jealousy. So he preferred to look
at the horse, did he? If he had chanced at that instant
to glance at her he would have seen a pair of blue eyes
blazing with wrath.</p>
<p>The two men came hurrying from the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Curly!&rdquo; said Haig, resigning his post.
&ldquo;Miss Gaylord has hurt her ankle. I found her unseated
down the road yonder.&rdquo; He paused, as if to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
let that be thoroughly understood. &ldquo;I want you to
hitch up the sorrels and drive her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; responded Curly, going into the stable.</p>
<p>Marion then did almost faint. She had not foreseen
that man&oelig;uver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not, please,&rdquo; she said, as sweetly as she
could in her dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather not what?&rdquo; asked Haig, turning at last to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather rest a while&ndash;&ndash;somewhere&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her
glance went past him in the direction of the cottage.
&ldquo;Then I can ride home&ndash;&ndash;alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tumble off in the road somewhere!&rdquo; he retorted,
with a touch of derision in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as bad as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter! I can&rsquo;t allow you to take any chances,&rdquo;
he insisted curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I need only a little rest,&rdquo; she persisted.
&ldquo;If I could lie down a few minutes&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her eyes again
were turned toward the cottage.</p>
<p>He saw what she meant, and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he snapped. Then, checking himself, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean to be inhospitable, but you ought to know
that&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;Cousin Seth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shot a look at her that frightened her, but gratified
her too. Was she rousing him at last?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like,&rdquo; he said, quietly enough. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
having a hard enough time with the fool without a
woman being mixed up in the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Of course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
not. Women never understand&ndash;&ndash;until afterwards.
I&rsquo;ll make it plainer. I&rsquo;m a bad man, as you have doubtless
heard. What would Paradise Park say when it
learned that you had been inveigled into my house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, let me sit here and rest!&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>She took her courage in both hands, and plunged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you,&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;I want
to ask you if there is no way&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to
talk to me. If I did&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, with a shrug. Marion felt her face reddening,
but she dissembled her embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid of me,
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was spoken archly, in her most playful, most kittenish
manner, and so she was amazed to see his face
distorted as if by some violent emotion. But he spoke
with restraint, though in a tone that was hard and harsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid of you. The only thing in the
world a man needs to fear is a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first effect of this speech was to surprise and
shock her. The next was to make her heart leap. Had
she come near the secret, after all? Then, finally, something
deep in the man&rsquo;s eyes roused in her a thrill of
pity. In another minute she would have melted, in her
compassion, and begged him humbly to pardon her.
But at that instant Curly emerged from the barn, leading
the sorrels; and the devil that lurks behind a
woman&rsquo;s tongue spoke for her before she was aware of
it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;d rather one of your men took me to Cousin
Seth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was scarcely out before she regretted it with all her
heart. If there was a devil behind her tongue there
was another back of the somber shadows in Haig&rsquo;s eyes.
He flashed one comprehending look at her; his whole
manner underwent a swift and terrifying change; he
was again the Philip Haig of that day at the post office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That will be the best joke
of all. I&rsquo;ll drive you home myself, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Marion sat very still on the soap box,
stunned, staring open-mouthed at Haig. What had she
done? That mad speech! Then she leaped to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You shall not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall not?&rdquo; he repeated sardonically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&ndash;&ndash;please not that!&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded, almost gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please! I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t mean it! Women never do
mean it&ndash;&ndash;that way. And I suppose you didn&rsquo;t mean
to let those men ride on to Paradise when they told you
the horse was mine, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Marion, almost in a scream. &ldquo;How
did you&ndash;&ndash;know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to ask Larkin if he had met nobody on
the road who could have directed him. He said there
was no one but a &lsquo;purty girl.&rsquo; That was you, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was speechless.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And my warning to Huntington. Did you deliver
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, scarcely above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. That would have been too simple
and honest and direct. You can&rsquo;t be honest and
straightforward to save your lives. You live by deception,
and boast about your love of truth. Your deepest
craving is for violence, while you prate about your gentle
influence over men. I haven&rsquo;t the least doubt in the
world that Mrs. Huntington, for all her baby face, is
back of all Huntington&rsquo;s violence&ndash;&ndash;thinks she&rsquo;s a wonderful
inspiration to him, with a special genius for the
cattle business! And when she gets him killed&ndash;&ndash;with
your assistance&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;ll flop down, and weep&ndash;&ndash;and
you too, both of you&ndash;&ndash;and wail that you didn&rsquo;t mean
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recoiled from him, and leaned helplessly against
the wall of the stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you let the men ride on to Paradise,&rdquo; he went on
with relentless mockery, &ldquo;and you let Huntington
plunge into that business when you knew, from me, exactly
what it meant. And you rode over here to-day&ndash;&ndash;I
wonder, now, if your foot&rsquo;s really hurt, or if that also
is some trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the merest chance shot. He had no suspicion
that she had been shamming, for he had been too much
annoyed by the whole incident to be critical of her
demeanor. But the shot went home. The girl, without
a word or cry, suddenly sank down on the box, with her
face buried in her hands.</p>
<p>There ensued a moment of tense silence. For all the
bitterness that surged under his railing speech, Haig
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
was not untouched by the sight of the girl, bent and
cowering before him. But at the same time he was
exasperated anew by the scene that was being enacted
under the eyes of his two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said presently, not without reluctant
gentleness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing late. We must start at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words increased her terror. Through the hands
that covered her eyes she could see Haig and Huntington&ndash;&ndash;with
revolvers drawn; and Claire&rsquo;s white face&ndash;&ndash;She
rose impulsively, dropping her hands from her hot
and tear-stained cheeks. She would confess all to him,
though it should betray the inmost secret of her heart;
and would beseech him not to go&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it&ndash;&ndash;here!&rdquo; he commanded sharply,
lowering his voice as he bent toward her. &ldquo;They think
there&rsquo;s something queer about all this. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed him silently, her resolution vanishing before
his authority. Besides, there was yet time, somewhere
on the road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE END OF HER STRATAGEM</h3>
</div>
<p>For some minutes there was no speech, no sound
except the swift beat of the horses&rsquo; hoofs on the
hard roadway, and the crisp crunching of wheels in the
sand. Marion sat rigid, staring straight in front of her,
yet seeing nothing. Dazed and benumbed, her thoughts
were in a hopeless tangle, without beginnings, without
ends. How she had bungled the whole thing! And
she might have been so happy, there at his side.</p>
<p>Twilight was coming on in the serene, clear beauty
of the mountains: the distant peaks glowed like great
opals in the sundown hues; there was an indescribable
sweetness in the air, something magical in the soft but
cold night breeze that began to pour down upon the
valley from the eternal snows.</p>
<p>Timidly, out of the corner of her eye, Marion glanced
at Haig, and saw that he was gazing steadily at the
changing colors on the distant range. But there was no
beauty for her in that perfect panorama. The fire had
gone out of her, and she was shivering. He must have
felt her movement, for suddenly he leaned forward,
lifted the edge of the heavy lap-robe that had lain
neglected at their feet, and tucked it around her. She
drew back with a quick intake of breath as his face was
for an instant close to her own. A moment later he
began to speak in a tone that surprised and encouraged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
her, so little did it resemble the tones he had employed
before. It was as if nothing had happened, as if they
had long been talking of things casual, impersonal to
them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different in the San Luis,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
red down there. Nature&rsquo;s palette is a little short of red
in this valley. Too much blue. Even nature sometimes
gets a one-color obsession, like the painters. Here
she&rsquo;s gone off on blue. It&rsquo;s the most dangerous color.
Darwin says it was the last color produced in nature&rsquo;s
laboratory. Ordinarily it&rsquo;s the least common in flowers
and birds and insects. Hearn&ndash;&ndash;Have you read Lafcadio
Hearn? No? But you ought to, that is, if you
care for such things. He goes after blue&ndash;&ndash;the misuse
of it. He says it&rsquo;s the color most pleasureable to the
eye in its purest intensity. But you mustn&rsquo;t dab it on.
A blue house is a crime. Blue&rsquo;s overdone here too, blue
sky, blue mists, blue shadows, blue lakes, blue flowers,&ndash;&ndash;anemones,
harebells, columbines and the rest. It&rsquo;s a
relief to get into the reds of the San Luis&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Sunnysides came from!&rdquo; interrupted Marion,
eager despite her misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about him, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted him to continue in that strain, and even
Sunnysides was a less dangerous subject than&ndash;&ndash;another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, about Sangre de Cristo first. That&rsquo;s a great
range that stands up high and white along the east.
Sangre de Cristo is Spanish for Blood of Christ. I
can see those pious old rascal adventurers uncovering
their blessed heads when they first glimpsed it. At sunset
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
it takes the color&ndash;&ndash;not always, not often, in fact,
perhaps a dozen times a year. There are days and days
when the range is only white and cold, days when it&rsquo;s
black with storms, and days when it&rsquo;s dismal gray.
Then there comes an evening when the sun goes down
red behind the San Juan, and the snows on Sangre de
Cristo run like blood. The whole world, for a few
minutes, seems to halt and stand still in awe at that
weird and mysterious spectacle&ndash;&ndash;trainmen setting the
brakes on squealing ore trains on Marshall Pass, and
miners coming out of their tunnels above Creed all stop
and look; Mexican sheep-herders in Conejos pause to
cross themselves; ranchmen by their lonely corrals up
and down the San Luis, and cowboys in the saddle on the
open range&ndash;&ndash;all spellbound. It gives you a strange
feeling&ndash;&ndash;something that goes back to the primitive instincts
of mankind&ndash;&ndash;something of reverence, something
of wonder, something of fear&ndash;&ndash;the fear that the first
men had when they gazed on the phenomena they could
not understand, and began to make their myths and
their religions. Primitive superstition, primitive terror
will never quite down in us, no matter how wise and
practical we become. There&rsquo;s always, in beauty&ndash;&ndash;in
sheer beauty something terrifying, as well as something
sad. But&ndash;&ndash;do I bore you with my dithyrambs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scene couldn&rsquo;t have been set better for that
spectacle. There&rsquo;s a green strip along the river, then
bare sagebrush flats, and beyond the flats are sand dunes
where nothing grows but cactus and mesquite, and here
and there some tufts of grass as tough and dry as wire.
In summer the dunes are a parched and blistered inferno.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
In October they are raw gray desolation. I
don&rsquo;t want to know what they are like in winter. The
wind never ceases there. It builds the dunes into new
shapes every day, and the sagebrush is always bent and
lopsided and torn, and the colors are the gray and
brown of the world&rsquo;s secret tragedy. But when the red
sunset is on the dunes there&rsquo;s nothing I have ever seen
so wild and passionate and beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was late in the autumn. I rode out of a deep
arroya, and came, without warning, into all that weird
and solemn glory. There was a cold gush of air from
up the valley. Far in the north were purple patches
on the flats, and violet shadows in the foothills. But the
dunes were all vermilion, and I can&rsquo;t tell you what hue
of red lay spread out deep and vivid on the Sangre de
Cristo peaks,&ndash;&ndash;a living, passionate, terrible blood-red.
I&rsquo;m not very devout, but I tell you candidly that I
reined up my horse, took off my hat, and sat there
gazing, with the queerest feelings, and saying, like the
old Spaniards, &lsquo;Sangre de Cristo! Blood of Christ!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then something queer happened to me. You&rsquo;ve
seen a flash of sunlight reflected from a window, far off?
Well, it wasn&rsquo;t like that, except in the sharpness of its
effect. And I knew there was no house in all that waste
of sand. It was just a flash, and was gone. I searched
the horizon, and saw nothing but red dunes, and little
puffs of sand kicked up by the rising wind. Must have
been some trick of vision, I thought, and I looked away
again toward the blood-red peaks. And there it was
again, in the corner of my eye. But it was gone when I
tried to fix it. I put spurs to my horse, and rode toward
the dunes, and caught the flash again&ndash;&ndash;just a bright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
yellow speck in the darkening vermilion. It came and
went, and seemed then to have been lost completely. I
was about convinced that the red sunset had gone to my
head&ndash;&ndash;that I was following something that existed only
in my brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as I loped up to the top of a dune&ndash;&ndash;there he
stood, on another dune, perhaps two hundred yards
away. His golden hide reflected the red glow like polished
metal, his mane flamed in the wind. You cannot
possibly imagine the effect of it, in that unreal light, in
that setting of desolation, with the crimson mountains
behind him. He stood alone on the hill, with his head
high, motionless as a statue. For as long as half a
minute he let me look at him. Then he turned, and
was gone like a flash of fire. I had just one more
glimpse of him, flying over the dunes, and followed by a
score or more of wild horses of all colors except his
color, and none worth looking at. With him the red
went out of the landscape, the peaks turned white, and
I sat alone in the gray, raw twilight. But right there I
made up my mind about one thing: I must have that
horse. You know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you mean to do with him?&rdquo; asked
Marion, vaguely troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mere folly, you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you don&rsquo;t mean that at all, Miss Gaylord.
You know perfectly well that if I were doing it to please
you&ndash;&ndash;to win your admiration&ndash;&ndash;you wouldn&rsquo;t call it
folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will please me&ndash;&ndash;and win my admiration&ndash;&ndash;if
you don&rsquo;t do it. Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want&ndash;&ndash;You&rsquo;ll pardon me?&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t want to win your admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could she say to that? There was a moment of
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for Farrish, my foreman. He&rsquo;s the
only man I can absolutely depend upon. He&rsquo;s in
Omaha. He&rsquo;ll be back next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t begin without him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had no choice but to be satisfied with a few days
of grace. Moreover, something might happen before
the return of Farrish; the outlaw might escape, or she
might find another opportunity to plead with Haig, or&ndash;&ndash;What
was she thinking of? Something was going to
happen that very evening; and she had almost forgotten
it, in her absorption!</p>
<p>She had meant to do, long before now, what he had
prevented her doing at the stable,&ndash;&ndash;to confess her deception,
to plead for mercy, to beg him to go back. Failing
in that, there was Tuesday trotting behind the trap;
she could leap out, prove to Haig that her foot was
uninjured, and insist upon riding home alone. But now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
the confession seemed ten times more difficult than it
had seemed in the first flush of her resolution. They
were far up the Brightwater by this time; a few minutes
more would bring them to the branch road that led to
Huntington&rsquo;s. Yet how could she tell him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My foot doesn&rsquo;t hurt any more,&rdquo; she began, compromising
with her resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been sitting still,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t hurt when I move it. See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted the foot, and rested it on the dashboard,
bending and twisting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By which you mean to tell me that I am to go back,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he answered curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t badly sprained at all,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;I
was only&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She caught herself, with a shock. &ldquo;I
was only frightened, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was not the truth in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it was now, her best occasion to come out with
it. But no; she could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad as I feared,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust not. A sprain is a bad business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll go back now!&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the reason!&rdquo; she cried desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, there&rsquo;s another reason. That makes two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other reason?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to ask Huntington about his health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deviltry had come back into his voice; and just
ahead of them she saw the fork of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a third reason too, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she answered
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to punish me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&ndash;&ndash;a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble? Manly? Kind? Generous?&rdquo; he broke
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think it&rsquo;s worth your while to punish
me?&rdquo; she asked with passionate irony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I hope to be let alone hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that her anger rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that is the way a man should speak to
a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be the only way to make a woman understand.
And even then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt that he shrugged his shoulders in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sorry for the women you have known!&rdquo;
she retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should make it all the easier for you to avoid
any more accidents in my part of the Park,&rdquo; he answered
unperturbed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own fault if I&rsquo;m rude. I
haven&rsquo;t forced my attentions upon you. If you feel that
you&rsquo;ve been mistreated, there&rsquo;s another reason&ndash;&ndash;that
makes four, doesn&rsquo;t it?&ndash;&ndash;for my going to Huntington&rsquo;s.
We&rsquo;ll be there in five minutes. You can tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>She could find no answer to all this. Brutal as it
was, she knew that she had deserved it. Her anger
fell away, for she had found already that she could
not be angry with him long; and now, even in her torment,
she began to be sorry for him, wondering what he
had passed through that had so hardened and embittered
him.</p>
<p>But the team had turned into the branch road; and
she must act at once. There remained but one thing
for her to do: to leap out of the trap, and refuse to go
farther with him. On the thought, she measured the
distance to the ground, the speed of the trotting sorrels.
Perhaps she moved a little. Or had he actually read
her thoughts? For suddenly, but very quietly, he laid
a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You might really hurt yourself
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank back in dismay, but with a thrill of admiration.
What was this man, who knew her thoughts
before she herself knew them, who mastered her&ndash;&ndash;and
despised her? She trembled, and was glad of the night
that concealed her flushed face from him. As for her
purpose, she was at the end of her resources. No confession,
no plea would avail to shake his determination.
She could do no more; and judgment was upon her&ndash;&ndash;soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold the reins, please!&rdquo; commanded Haig.</p>
<p>He leaped out of the trap, opened the gate, and closed
it when he had led the sorrels through. Then he climbed
into the trap, and drove on. There was no moon. The
ranch buildings lay huddled and indistinct in the dim
starlight.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>At the sound of the hoofs and wheels a man emerged
from the stable, bearing a lantern. He hurried up to
them, stumbling sleepily, and peering at the figures
vaguely seen in the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Williams!&rdquo; Haig said shortly. &ldquo;Hold my
team, will you! I&rsquo;ll be only a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lantern fell from the man&rsquo;s hand, struck the
ground with a clatter, and lay on its side, flaming and
smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick it up!&rdquo; ordered Haig.</p>
<p>The man obeyed, with the suddenness of a jack-in-the-box,
and stood as if petrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! The horses! They&rsquo;re no damned broncos!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams jumped to the bridles; and a gleam from the
lantern showed Marion his face. His mouth was open,
his eyes staring with incredulity and alarm. She was
seized with a preposterous desire to laugh at that comical
visage, made grotesque by the wavering light of the
lantern that danced in the fellow&rsquo;s hand. She was on
the verge of hysteria.</p>
<p>Haig leaped out, and held up his arms for her, snapping
his fingers impatiently. In almost complete inertia,
yet with every nerve quivering, she let him help
her to the ground, where he placed her arm in his, and
started toward the ranch house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Limp! Limp!&rdquo; he whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>She obeyed him mechanically. Everything seemed
to have become very still and cold; feeling had frozen in
her limbs; terror clutched at her icily out of the gloom.
There were two lighted windows in front of her, two
baleful yellow gleams, like the eyes of a monster of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
night. At any instant the door would open, gulping
her in.</p>
<p>She choked down a cry. Her feet were like lead now,
and she stumbled on the first of the half-dozen steps that
led to the veranda. Haig pulled her up quickly, flung
his right arm around her waist, and fairly carried her
up the steps. At that moment, just as they stood on the
level floor, the door was opened, and Huntington&rsquo;s huge
body appeared in silhouette against the lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Marion?&rdquo; he called out, peering into the
darkness. Then, almost instantly: &ldquo;Somebody with
you, Marion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig answered for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Cousin Seth!&rdquo; he called out cheerily.
&ldquo;I just dropped in to ask about your health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For perhaps as long as it took him to catch his arrested
breath, Huntington stood motionless. Then, with an
oath, he bounded back into the room, and disappeared,
as Marion dully realized, in the direction of his room,
where his revolver hung on a rack. She felt the form
beside her straighten out like a loosed spring; and the
next instant she was borne swiftly forward into the
light, into the house, into the scene she had pictured, the
scene she herself had prepared. The arm that supported
her was quickly withdrawn, and she was left
standing at one side of the door, while Haig leaped away
from her, and stood waiting at the other.</p>
<p>Even as this was done, Huntington reappeared at
the door of his bedroom. The revolver in his right hand
moved slowly upward. In the kitchen doorway was
Claire&ndash;&ndash;a stricken thing in blue and gold&ndash;&ndash;clinging
to the doorpost, her lips parted, her eyes wide with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
terror. But Haig! Could anything have been more
horrible than that smile? It was fearless, mocking, insolent.
And his whole attitude matched it perfectly.
He stood carelessly erect, with arms folded, disdaining
Huntington&rsquo;s weapon. But not the slightest motion of
his enemy&ndash;&ndash;perhaps not even the thought before it&ndash;&ndash;could
have escaped him. Marion knew him; and she
felt as certain as if it had already happened that if Seth
lifted his revolver by so much as another inch he would
be stretched out on the floor there as he had been on the
ground at Paradise.</p>
<p>All this she saw in an interval as brief as that between
two clicks of the shutter of her kodak. Then the clock
on the mantel began to strike. It was a friendly clock,
with a musical, soft note. But now its stroke crashed
upon the silence like a tolling bell. It seemed to have
its part in that halted scene, as if all waited on its last
solemn count. If she could only move, think, speak,
before it finished!</p>
<p>The next thing she knew she was in the middle of the
room, directly between the two men, and speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Seth!&rdquo; she heard herself saying. &ldquo;I did it.
I brought him here to&ndash;&ndash;to make peace with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ended on the clock&rsquo;s last note; and silence fell
again. Huntington&rsquo;s jaw dropped; amazement was
printed on his face, and incredulity. Marion walked
quietly up to him, took the revolver from his hand, and
left him standing in the doorway, his arms hanging
loose at his side. She crossed the room to Haig, slowly,
somewhat gropingly like a somnambulist, with a half-smiling,
strange expression fixed on her chalk-white
face. She stretched out her left hand to him, her right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
still clasping Seth&rsquo;s six-shooter. There was something
magnetic, curiously compelling in her manner; for she
said nothing, made no sound. Haig stared at her, the
odious smile fading from his lips; his arms slowly fell
apart, one hand in the direction of the revolver at his
hip; and for a moment it seemed that he too would yield
to her. But suddenly he threw back his head, and
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jupiter!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was in
you. You almost got me too. Good night&ndash;&ndash;all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that he turned on his heel, and vanished into the
night. Marion heard him laughing still as his boots
crunched on the gravel; heard his voice in brief and
sharp command at the stable; heard the beat of the sorrels&rsquo;
hoofs on the road, and the fragment of a song
wafted back to her,&ndash;&ndash;something rollicking and insolent,
in a foreign tongue. She stood listening until the
sounds had died away in the night, and silence enveloped
her. Then, just as Huntington leaped forward with a
bellow of rage,&ndash;&ndash;too late, as ever,&ndash;&ndash;and Claire, with a
shriek, rushed to throw herself between him and the
door, Marion&rsquo;s head drooped forward, her knees gave
way, and she fell senseless on the floor.</p>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s big revolver, slipping from her nerveless
fingers as she fell, struck the Navajo rug with a
muffled thump, bounced and rolled over, and settled
down harmlessly on a patch of barbaric red.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>HEARTS INSURGENT</h3>
</div>
<p>Seth recovered his revolver, and lunged toward the
door. But Claire was before him. She flung herself
upon him, clutching the lapels of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seth! Seth!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow him!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow him!
I&rsquo;ll end the whole thing! I&rsquo;ll finish it, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she wailed; and clung to him frantically.</p>
<p>He was beside himself, almost incoherent, for the
moment quite irresponsible. It is very likely that, but
for Claire, he would have mounted a horse and pursued
Haig to his ranch, with such consequences as anybody
except himself could easily have foreseen. But he was
not so far gone in frenzy as to hurt Claire, as he must
have done in tearing himself loose from her. He stood
a moment in tragic helplessness, grinding his teeth, and
hurling muttered imprecations out into the night that
covered Philip Haig. Then he looked down at the
golden head pressed against his breast, and felt the frail
body quivering; and some sense of what he was doing, or
was about to do, reached his brain through the fumes of
rage. There was yet a long struggle; for he was too
ponderous for quick decisions, and at the same time too
outright for successful equivocation. Defeat was always
a staggering blow to him, since he had no art to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
mask it. And now, lacking the sagacity to swallow his
mortification and to bide his time, he could only suffer,
rending himself in lieu of another on whom to pour his
fury.</p>
<p>In the midst of this futile passion his roving eyes fell
on Marion. She lay where she had fallen, in a dead
faint, limp on the red-and-yellow rug. Seth stared at
her a full minute, while an indefinable suspicion grew
in the back of his brain. She had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought
him here to make peace with you.&rdquo; And Haig himself
had given the lie to that speech! What did it all mean?
By God, he would find out!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Claire!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Attend to Marion!&rdquo;
And he began to loosen her fingers from his coat.</p>
<p>But she only clutched it the tighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Not to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>She looked steadily up at him, questioning, fearful,
until he bent down and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, roughly and yet not ungently.
&ldquo;Now go to Marion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They picked her up, and laid her on the couch at
one side of the big room; and Claire unbuttoned her
dress at the throat, and bathed her face and neck with
cold water, while Seth rubbed and slapped her hands.</p>
<p>Her first impulse, on opening her eyes and seeing
Claire and Seth leaning over her, was to raise her head,
and look toward the door. She saw only a patch of
darkness, empty and still. Then she remembered how
she had heard his mocking voice fade away in the night;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
and her eyes returned to Seth and Claire. Their faces
told her what to expect: and she knew that they were
right in demanding, as they would demand, the fullest
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water, please!&rdquo; she murmured, moistening her dry
lips with her tongue.</p>
<p>She sat up, slowly emptied the glass that Claire placed
in her trembling hand, then buttoned her collar over her
bare throat, and began to pin up the locks of hair that
had fallen about her face and neck. Her hands, she
thought, were very thin and white. She had never
fainted before, and was still a little frightened and surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean, Marion?&rdquo; demanded Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Seth, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; warned Claire. Then to
Marion: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry, dear. When you feel
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her eyes denied her words. There was indeed no
way out of it. Marion must speak, and without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold,&rdquo; she said, shivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried Claire. &ldquo;Come to the fire.
And Seth! Close the door, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington strode to the door, and slammed it shut.
Then he returned to the chimney piece, and watched
Marion as she leaned toward the blaze. He could barely
restrain himself, waiting for her to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a silly fool, I suppose,&rdquo; she said presently,
sitting erect again, and facing her cousins courageously.
&ldquo;It was all my fault. You mustn&rsquo;t blame him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An impatient exclamation by Huntington drew a
warning glance from Claire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us just what happened, dear!&rdquo; she urged
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t just understand
how it happened,&rdquo; Marion began. &ldquo;I had an accident&ndash;&ndash;in
the road. My foot was hurt&ndash;&ndash;my ankle was
twisted&ndash;&ndash;or I thought it was&ndash;&ndash;and I was frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An accident?&rdquo; said Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was off my pony&ndash;&ndash;the cinches were loose&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;when
I tried to mount again&ndash;&ndash;I slipped&ndash;&ndash;somehow&ndash;&ndash;and
fell. He was just in time to help me,
and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo; asked Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just below his place. He was coming back&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what were you doing over there?&rdquo; demanded
Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Riding,&rdquo; she said calmly, perhaps a little defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that. But on his land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever tell me anything about that?&rdquo; she
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how was I to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve heard&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard some things at the post-office. You&rsquo;ve
told me nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s face reddened angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that now!&rdquo; cried Claire sharply, sending
another warning look at Seth. &ldquo;Go on, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion went on, very carefully. With Claire alone
she might have been more frank and confiding, but
Seth&rsquo;s belligerent attitude had begun to stir resentment
in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought I had a bad sprain. He was annoyed;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
he didn&rsquo;t take any pains to conceal that from me. But
he lifted me into the saddle, and rode with me to his
stable, and told one of his men to hitch up a team, and
drive me home. That would have been&ndash;&ndash;all right, and
he had no intention&ndash;&ndash;until&ndash;&ndash;something I said&ndash;&ndash;I
must have been hysterical&ndash;&ndash;something made him angry,
and he&ndash;&ndash;said he would drive me home himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you let him!&rdquo; cried Claire reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t <i>let</i> him. He did it in spite of all I
could do. I pleaded with him, I tried every way to stop
him. Once I started to leap out of the trap. But he
caught me. He laughed at me But he was very angry
too; he scolded me dreadfully. Said I needed to be
punished for&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know what. He hates women,
and says we&rsquo;re always meddling in men&rsquo;s affairs. It
served me right, of course. And please remember it
was all my fault&ndash;&ndash;truly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say anything about making peace?&rdquo; asked
Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That was all mine. I had to do something
quickly. You know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did he say about me?&rdquo; growled Huntington,
who was far from satisfied, and still suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. Oh, yes!&rdquo; she added impulsively.
&ldquo;He said you and he could probably come to an understanding
quickly enough if&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what?&rdquo; demanded Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only because he dislikes women, I think.
He said&ndash;&ndash;if Claire&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Huntington, he said,&ndash;&ndash;would
let you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried Claire. It was almost a scream of astonishment
and indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him!&rdquo; shouted Huntington. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d better
keep her name out of it, or I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything!&rdquo; wailed Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him pay for that!&rdquo; bellowed Huntington,
bringing his fist down on the mantel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t blame him!&rdquo; protested Marion hastily.
&ldquo;He was angry at me, and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s as
bad as you think he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; cried Claire, her eyes widening with
wonder.</p>
<p>Then Marion had the misfortune to blush under
Claire&rsquo;s curious gaze. She blushed, at first, merely because
she had gone too far in her effort to clear Haig of
responsibility for what had occurred that evening; and
then the blood stormed into her cheeks as she encountered
Claire&rsquo;s look, and attached a deeper meaning to it
than it actually conveyed.</p>
<p>Huntington leaned forward, and gazed suspiciously
into Marion&rsquo;s crimsoned face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
think the girl was in love with this ruffian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant there was a silence much like the
silence that follows a clap of thunder. Then Marion
rose slowly to her feet, quivering, her eyes ablaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruffian?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any ruffian
it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught herself. She was innately gentle and
fastidious, and she could not, without shame, have
forced her lips to say the things that she felt in her outraged
heart. But she looked at him; and under that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
look Seth quailed and shrank. What had he said to
evoke this luminous hatred? He had not meant&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think she&rsquo;s right, Seth Huntington!&rdquo; exclaimed
Claire, coming to Marion, and putting an arm,
around her. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any ruffian it&rsquo;s you, and I&rsquo;m
ashamed of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s jaw dropped, and he stared at them, his
eyes bulging with astonishment. Then suddenly he
turned, and bolted from the room. The door leading to
the kitchen was flung shut behind him; then the outer
door banged; and in a moment his heavy footsteps were
heard on the veranda, where he strode to and fro in
helpless rage and shame and wonder. He had a feeling
of soreness over all his body, as if some one had roundly
pummelled him; his face itched beneath his beard; he
could not find a comfortable place for his hands. Well,
he agreed with Haig about one thing: women were hell!
And here was Claire siding with Marion against him;
and calling him a ruffian! Was he a ruffian? What
had he said to merit that? Couldn&rsquo;t they take a joke?
But this casuistry did not go down, though he tried to
hammer it down with many violent gestures. He began
to have certain qualms that he recognized as premonitory
signs of weakening; and he struggled to bolster up
his anger. Damn Haig! If he had only finished him
that day in the timber, when the others had wanted to!
But this was a vain regret. There remained the present
situation. Gradually his steps faltered. He stopped
often to look vacantly at the stars. They had nothing
to say to him. He felt very solitary, alone in the
world.</p>
<p>After a time the kitchen door was opened softly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Seth!&rdquo; came a whisper from that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he answered uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are. The fire&rsquo;s going out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please fetch some wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No reply. Claire slipped out, and crept up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she commanded softly. &ldquo;Do you want us
to freeze?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re not going to bed until you come
in and beg Marion&rsquo;s pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to clap her hand over his mouth, but succeeded
only in hitting his nose a smart tap, which was
just as effective, since it checked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No swearing, either!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
been rude enough for one night, don&rsquo;t you think? I&rsquo;ll
tell you my opinion of it later. She&rsquo;s going to be easy
with you because she&rsquo;s sorry about it all. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington did not move, or answer her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want her to leave by the next stage&ndash;&ndash;and
have this all over the Park too&ndash;&ndash;like Haig&rsquo;s visit?
Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He groaned, but followed her. At the door of the
living room he caught sight of Marion seated before the
fireplace, where only embers glowed dull red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some wood,&rdquo; he said quickly, glad of even
a few minutes&rsquo; grace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>Fortune tossed him a small favor: the wood bin
near the kitchen door was empty&ndash;&ndash;almost. Another
time that would have brought a storm down on the
head of the unlucky stable hand whose duty it was
to keep the bin filled. But now Seth rejoiced at
having to go to the wood yard, and found it much too
near.</p>
<p>He re-entered the house with an armload of sticks,
and placed them carefully on the embers; stirred up the
glowing mass with a poker; readjusted the fresh wood;
provoked the red coals once more; and at last, having
exhausted the dilatory possibilities of the fire, stood up
clumsily to face the ordeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Marion,&rdquo; he began awkwardly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in for it,
I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not reply; she only looked at him. There
were dark shadows around her eyes that heightened the
pallor of her cheeks; but the eyes themselves were clear
and piercing, and as cold now as they had been fiery
before. For once in his life Huntington was conscious
of his bulk; he felt conspicuous; and the wound in his
shoulder, almost healed, began to itch and ache.&ndash;&ndash;There
were worse things than being shot.&ndash;&ndash;If she
would only turn those eyes away from him! And then
it dawned upon him that she was waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Marion!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I
was ugly. I didn&rsquo;t really mean&ndash;&ndash;I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute longer she let him stew in his kettle,
then lifted him out scrupulously, at the end of a very
long fork, and dropped him steaming, as if he had been
a lump of unsavory fat.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I forgive you,&rdquo; she said, very, very distantly.
&ldquo;You probably weren&rsquo;t thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If that was forgiveness! But he did not know&ndash;&ndash;even
Claire did not know then&ndash;&ndash;how deeply he had
wounded Marion with his rude and accusing speech,&ndash;&ndash;as
if he had called a jeering crowd to look at the little
flower that blooms but once, and very secretly, in a
woman&rsquo;s heart. Forgive him? She never would forgive
him for that blundering outburst, which was indeed
the more unforgivable because he did not seriously
mean, and certainly did not believe, the thing he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Marion dear!&rdquo; said Claire softly.</p>
<p>At that Marion suddenly rushed to Claire, and knelt
by her chair. She had her own faults to be forgiven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very foolish!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caused
you pain and humiliation. I&rsquo;m sorry. Please forgive
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they cried it out in each other&rsquo;s arms, while Huntington
rolled a cigarette, took one whiff of it, and tossed
it into the fire. It required a stronger narcotic than
tobacco to soothe his fevered spirits. After a while he
whirled around and faced the two women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Marion!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all our fault
for not telling you about Haig. But we didn&rsquo;t want to
annoy you with our troubles, and we never imagined
you&rsquo;d stumble on to him. Do you know now what this
is all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spared him the answer that she had heard something
on that point the day of the shooting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that is, very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just this: Before he came here we were
all playing the game peacefully together. Each of us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
had just about enough land, with the cut hay and the
winter pastures, to pull through the winter, and there
was just enough free grazing up in the edges of the
timber to keep the cattle going through the summer and
early fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was government land,&rdquo; explained Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And open to all of us,&rdquo; added Seth. &ldquo;We never
had any dispute with the Englishman who owned Haig&rsquo;s
ranch before him, and he got fair treatment, though he
wasn&rsquo;t here much of the time to look after it. We heard
he had some family trouble, and one day when he&rsquo;d
been gone a long time&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s four years now,&rdquo; interrupted Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Haig showed up, and said the ranch was his.
He started in straight off to hog the whole thing.
Bought a thousand head of cattle&ndash;&ndash;that made thirteen
hundred head&ndash;&ndash;almost as many as all the rest of us
had put together. He turned the thirteen hundred into
the open range, and hired men to keep them moving the
right way for the good feed, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a perfect right to do that, you see,&rdquo; Claire
put in hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legal right, maybe,&rdquo; Huntington went on. &ldquo;But
he didn&rsquo;t have any real right to more than his share.
We organized, bunched our cattle, and stayed with &rsquo;em.
That way we were stronger than he, and soon had his
cattle starving. Then he disappeared, and we didn&rsquo;t
see anything of him for three weeks. And what do you
suppose the damned skunk&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seth!&rdquo; cried Claire warningly, with an anxious
look at Marion.</p>
<p>Marion merely shook her head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he fooled us. He went to Denver, got a lawyer
on the job, looked up the records, found there&rsquo;d been
a mistake in the surveys, and came back to us with a
government deed to almost half the forest reserve that
we&rsquo;d been using as free pasture. Then he ordered us
off, and we went, with six Winchesters pointed at our
fool backs. What do you think of that, Marion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked Marion. &ldquo;I mean what was his
motive in all that? He isn&rsquo;t a cattleman. I mean&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t think he cares enough&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, finding herself in dangerous waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Because he&rsquo;s a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Huntington checked
himself. &ldquo;Anyhow, he barely escaped a lynching that
night. And if he only knew it, I&rsquo;m the one that stopped
it. I said we&rsquo;d find some other way. But we haven&rsquo;t
found it. We had to bring most of our stock down to
the pastures we needed for winter, and in winter we had
to buy hay at eighteen dollars a ton. And Haig had
hay to sell. Three of our men were driven out of
business. Tom Jenkins, being dead broke and discouraged,
with a family, killed himself. I had to sell
off a third of my cattle, and twenty head disappeared,
and I never saw them again. And maybe you can understand
now how I felt when I saw him this evening,
standing there in my own house, grinning at me.
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, grabbed up the poker, and began jabbing
viciously at the fire.</p>
<p>Yes, Marion could understand that, but&ndash;&ndash;She was
not satisfied. There was something missing from Seth&rsquo;s
narrative. Haig&rsquo;s accusations that day at the post-office&ndash;&ndash;his
missing cattle, and the cut wires at the Forbidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Pasture&ndash;&ndash;And if all that Seth had said was true,
which she doubted, the mystery was only deepened.
She was sure that Haig was only playing a part, that
he was not a cattleman by choice, and that his heart was
not in the game, whatever it was. She wanted to ask
questions, but refrained, lest she should again arouse
Seth&rsquo;s suspicions. She would see Smythe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL</h3>
</div>
<p>The next afternoon Huntington, with painful diffidence,
yet anxious to come to some sort of terms
with Marion, proposed that she should begin her shooting
lessons. She acquiesced in a manner that relieved
him immensely, for she, on her side, was sorely in need
of distraction. So they were presently on the hillside
behind the ranch house with the rifles,&ndash;&ndash;Seth&rsquo;s Winchester
and the little Savage he had bought for Claire,
who, to his great disappointment, did not like guns, and
never could be taught to see the sights with one eye
closed. His delight, therefore, was unbounded when
Marion took to the Savage with almost the quick adaptability
of a man. True, her first shots went high and
wild among the foliage, but she was fast getting the grip
of the gun, and had actually once scraped the bark of
the tree on which the target of white paper was tacked,
when they were hailed by a cheerful voice demanding
permission for an unarmed and perfectly harmless man
to approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smythe!&rdquo; growled Huntington, resenting the
interruption. Then aloud, as heartily as he could:
&ldquo;Hello, Smythe! You&rsquo;re quite safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here, anyhow?&rdquo; asked Smythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your boasted powers of observation?&rdquo;
retorted Marion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more polite to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Paradise Park?&rdquo; she queried, in a tone of mild
surprise.</p>
<p>Seth&rsquo;s face reddened as he stooped over a half-empty
cartridge-box. He had congratulated himself too soon.
But while Smythe and Marion exchanged more badinage
he refilled the magazine of the Savage, and held it ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have another try?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please, if Mr. Smythe will only keep still. I
know I can never hit anything if he talks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mum!&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>The first shot went wild. So, indeed, the second and
third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! What did I tell you?&rdquo; cried Marion petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t say a word!&rdquo; protested Smythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you thinking, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a charming Diana&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think any more, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t stop thinking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case you&rsquo;d better talk. You certainly talk
enough without thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo; he cried joyously. &ldquo;Now try
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must learn not to be bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed her lips together, and steadied herself
resolutely. She would show him! The next shot cut
a furrow in the bark of the pine; the second struck
within two inches of the target; and the third pinked
the edge of the paper itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do for this time,&rdquo; she said, in some elation,
as she handed the gun to Huntington.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow you&rsquo;ll do better,&rdquo; he assured her.
&ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll try it at longer range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to pick up the cartridge boxes and his own
rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not riding to-day?&rdquo; said Smythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you guess it?&rdquo; she demanded, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a truce! A truce!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I mean, if
you are not going for a ride, will you walk up the hill
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed toward the pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To please me,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>But she caught a look in his eyes that decided her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you are so easily pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a very Lazarus at the table of life!&rdquo; he retorted
gaily. &ldquo;Every crumb comforts me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, and stepped away with him among the
rocks, while Huntington, still swearing at Smythe for a
meddling fool, strode down the hill.</p>
<p>Marion surmised that Smythe had something to say
to her. Had he heard already? Had the news of yesterday&rsquo;s
comedy, that was so near a tragedy, already
spread far and wide over the Park? But that was
scarcely possible, since Haig&rsquo;s men would be silent,
and Seth had kept Williams too busy all day for
gossip.</p>
<p>They climbed the rocky slope without more words,
clambering over bowlders and fallen tree trunks, until
they reached the summit of the hill, and flung themselves
down, hot and panting, on a great flat rock that
commanded a sweeping view of the Park. At one side
more hills rose, small mountains in themselves, thickly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
wooded, with white peaks towering behind. On the
other, the valley of the Brightwater lay green and bronze
in the sun, with the white stream curling and curving
among the meadows. Far across the valley, beyond the
ridge that divided the Park in unequal halves&ndash;&ndash;that
fateful ridge!&ndash;&ndash;the western range of mountains glittered,
dazzling white.</p>
<p>Marion&rsquo;s eyes at once sought out Thunder Mountain.
What would it say to her to-day? Storm! Its top
was half-hidden in a gray-black swirl of clouds, though
the sun was bright on the snow-clad peaks around
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; asked Smythe, as soon as his
lungs would consent to speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mountain,&rdquo; she answered, without turning her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph! You&rsquo;re welcome to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why your mountain?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must be a reason&ndash;&ndash;or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it&ndash;&ndash;something. It&rsquo;s hideous, but it
fascinates me. I can&rsquo;t help thinking that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got a bad reputation,&rdquo; said Smythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she was embarrassed, thinking unexpectedly of
another bad reputation in the Park.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he answered, smiling at the back of her
head, where the tawny hair curved up adorably from the
soft, white neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it!&rdquo; she said at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a death trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;men have gone up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a trail, what&rsquo;s left of it. The Warpath,
they call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Warpath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was first a war trail, when fighting tribes
lived in these mountains. But even the Indians didn&rsquo;t
use it often&ndash;&ndash;only in midsummer. It&rsquo;s a trail over
bare rocks, marked by stones set up at long intervals.
The Indians didn&rsquo;t mark it. They had their own ways
of knowing it. But after the Indians came trappers,
hunters, prospectors, and some of them set up the
stones. It would be a valuable short cut between the
Park and the San Luis country, if it were safe. But
it&rsquo;s not. I&rsquo;m told that many lives have been lost on it.
I can&rsquo;t find details except of one tragedy. Some ten
years ago a party of English people, guests at the ranch
that Haig now owns, went on a pleasure trip to Thunder
Mountain. They meant to go only as far as timber
line. It&rsquo;s not difficult as far as the foot of the scarp
that lifts to the flat top you see yonder. It&rsquo;s done on
horseback to that point&ndash;&ndash;and across too, if you care
to try it. But on top&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s another matter. It isn&rsquo;t
the mountain itself that gets you. It&rsquo;s the storms.
The English party ventured on top, and three of them
never came back. The wind hurled them into a chasm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
and their bodies were never recovered. That&rsquo;s enough
for me, thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has nobody in the Park ever been across?&rdquo; Marion
persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Parker&ndash;&ndash;Jim Parker&rsquo;s father&ndash;&ndash;crossed it
once, many years ago. But he came back another way,
around by Tellurium. Young Parker has been as far
as the Devil&rsquo;s Chair. That&rsquo;s the top of the notch where
the wind sucks you into it&ndash;&ndash;unless, by good chance, it
blows you away from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no one else?&rdquo; Marion insisted, breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One other man has gone to the Twin Sisters.
That&rsquo;s halfway over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; she asked; as if she did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He balked at the women, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smythe chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Twin Sisters,&rdquo; Smythe went on, &ldquo;are two
huge gray rocks, I&rsquo;m told, vaguely resembling carved
figures. The trail passes between them. There&rsquo;s no
other possible way, and when the wind is blowing it
shoots out between them like water from a fire-hose.
Haig was caught just there by a storm. He came back
fighting mad, and swore he&rsquo;d cross Thunder Mountain
yet, or die there. But that reminds me. I&rsquo;ve got news
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; asked Marion, with a start.</p>
<p>Her first thought was of Sunnysides. Had Haig decided
not to wait for Farrish? But no! It would be
something about yesterday&rsquo;s sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It keeps well, I see,&rdquo; she said lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to excite you so soon after that long
climb.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! If you think I can&rsquo;t stand it you just
keep it to yourself&ndash;&ndash;if you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I came expressly to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you expressly tell me? Don&rsquo;t be
exasperating, Mr. Smythe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned exultantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been eavesdropping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not intentionally. Pure accident. But I didn&rsquo;t
stick my fingers in my ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can understand that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. It was this way: I was fishing&ndash;&ndash;for
fish, really. Under a clump of willows, just where the
road from Haig&rsquo;s joins the main valley road. You
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haig and another man, Higgins, it turned out to be&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
a Denver lawyer&ndash;&ndash;with his family for an outing
down at Cobalt Lake. It appeared he&rsquo;d been up to
see Haig partly on business and partly just for a
friendly visit. They separated there, after a little conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s strange you&rsquo;ve never heard a word from him,&rsquo;
said Higgins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Four years,&rsquo; answered Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s probably off in South Africa somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or India. It&rsquo;s a long trail be followed, no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can only wait, I suppose,&rsquo; Higgins said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve nothing else to do,&rsquo; Haig replied, with
a laugh.&rdquo; Smythe paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something to think about,&rdquo; he said musingly.
&ldquo;Who is this &lsquo;he&rsquo;? And why is Haig waiting for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
him? Well, that was all I heard about that. Higgins
next asked Haig if he wouldn&rsquo;t please change his mind
about riding down to see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; Haig answered. &lsquo;I never go anywhere.
I&rsquo;m not very sociable, no longer a gregarious creature.
Ask my neighbors about that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, hang your neighbors! This is different.
We&rsquo;re not living here, and we can&rsquo;t pester you. But
you see I got Hail Columbia from my wife for not
bringing you to see her in Denver, and she&rsquo;s dead set on
getting acquainted with you here. She says you&rsquo;re the
most unselfish man in the world. I&rsquo;d be jealous if&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, come now!&rsquo; protested Haig, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s true. So you&rsquo;ll drop this hermit business for
once, won&rsquo;t you? It will give my wife much pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, have your own way,&rsquo; said Haig at last &lsquo;I
suppose a man&rsquo;s got to humor his lawyer, if he doesn&rsquo;t
want to lose a plain case some day. But I warn you.
I&rsquo;m not very amusing, that is, I trust not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; cried Higgins. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll not keep you long.
The day after to-morrow, shall we say? Right! Now
good-by! And don&rsquo;t let Huntington pot you&ndash;&ndash;before
you&rsquo;ve seen Mrs. Higgins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both laughed at that. Higgins drove off down
the valley in his road wagon, and Haig galloped toward
home. And then I found a trout had run away with my
hook. Big fellow too, and clever as Satan. Scuttled
away under a rock and worked loose before I could get
after him. But it was a good day&rsquo;s fishing just the
same, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not reply at once; and Smythe discreetly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
busied himself tossing stones at an impertinent chipmunk
that popped in and out among the rocks and
fallen limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen this Mrs. Higgins?&rdquo; asked Marion
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Smythe answered gravely, though his eyes
twinkled wickedly. &ldquo;But Higgins is sixty at least, and
I fancy his wife&rsquo;s too old to be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; A warning look
checked him. &ldquo;But really, Miss Gaylord, you ought
not to jump down my throat after I&rsquo;ve brought you such
an interesting knot for your pretty hands to untie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at his lugubrious countenance, then stood
up, and reached out a hand to him, letting him hold it
for just a breath of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re a good friend. I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very deep,&rdquo; he said, with a touch of dejection.
&ldquo;Nobody ever takes me very seriously. But I
hope you&rsquo;ll trust me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will! But come! We must go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went slipping and sliding down the hill,
digging their heels into the ground, clinging to rocks
and trees to check their swift descent, laughing at their
wild plunges and gyrations. At the house, when they
had rested a while on the veranda, Marion dismissed
Smythe as quickly as she could without abruptness; and
when he had gone she hastened to her room, and locked
the door, and flung herself down on the bed, with her
hands clasped behind her head, to stare up at the ceiling
in a whirl of thoughts. There was a mystery! There
was a motive behind Haig&rsquo;s conduct! &ldquo;The most unselfish
man in the world&rdquo; And she repeated the words
over and over again, and gathered them to her heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AVALANCHE</h3>
</div>
<p>Huntington soon had his revenge on Marion,
though, in his blindness, he never knew it. She
and Claire, after an unusually protracted Small Talk
the night before, arose late one morning to find the
house topsy-turvy from masculine activity. On the
veranda they discovered Seth cleaning rifles, surrounded
by cartridge boxes, hunting knives, canvas bags and
wrappings, rubber coats, leather straps, fishing tackle
and what not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of goodness, Seth Huntington! What
are you doing?&rdquo; shrilled Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo; replied Huntington, with a rather heavy
attempt at tantalizing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know! Camping. But you don&rsquo;t mean to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you ask us?&rdquo; demanded Claire.
&ldquo;Maybe we don&rsquo;t choose&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do, though. I promised Marion that as
soon as I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, for even his habitually veiled eyes could
not miss the look of consternation on Marion&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I thought&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began uncertainly. &ldquo;Of
course, if you don&rsquo;t want to go&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oiled rag dropped from his hand. His descent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
from elation (he had planned a little surprise) to dejection
and chagrin was a tumble that touched Marion&rsquo;s
commiseration and disarmed her. She did not want to
go camping; she did not want to leave the Park for even
a day, an hour; she did not want to miss any opportunity
to see Haig. More than ever now was she determined
to solve his mystery. So Huntingdon&rsquo;s &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; was
a greater shock to her than he, simple man, could possibly
have foreseen or perceived. But even if she had
not been moved by his rather ludicrous disappointment
she would not have dared to refuse acquiescence in his
programme. She had indeed expressed an ardent&ndash;&ndash;oh,
too ardent!&ndash;&ndash;desire to go camping, and any explanation
she could think of on the instant would have led
her into regions where she could not trust herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I want to go!&rdquo; she cried quickly, though
there was a big lump in her throat. &ldquo;You took me by
surprise, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so!&rdquo; said Claire. &ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re
smart, don&rsquo;t you? We might have been all dressed for
it if you&rsquo;d only told us. When do we start, Big Boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington recovered his good spirits quickly, assured
that he had succeeded after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d ride to Ely&rsquo;s to-day, sleep there to-night,
and make Mount Avalanche to-morrow evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must hurry,&rdquo; said Claire. &ldquo;Come,
Marion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long&ndash;&ndash;shall we be gone?&rdquo; asked Marion,
struggling to appear enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four or five days, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart sank. She could have cried with vexation.
But she managed to conceal her real feelings in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
the bustle of preparation. There were provisions to be
packed: cans and jars and bottles; bacon and ham and
flour against the possible event of bad luck with the
guns and rods; warm clothes and bedding; medicines
and bandages. So fully occupied were her hands and
brain with these details, and later with her first real
experience with the mountain trails, that her heart must
perforce keep its peace until some hour of solitude.</p>
<p>Toward five o&rsquo;clock of the second day they reached
their destination,&ndash;&ndash;a grassy shelf a little below timber
line on Mount Avalanche. There, in some past age,
an avalanche of titanic proportions had carried away
part of the mountain itself; and they camped now on the
top of the d&eacute;bris, long since concealed by a dense forest
growth, as if nature had employed her utmost arts to
hide the wound. Marion could not but yield a little to
emotions of delight and wonder. On that high platform
she stood above a marvelous mountain world,
below another mountain world as marvelous. Behind
her Avalanche reared sheer and sharp and white against
the sky. On either side were snow-clad peaks. At her
feet were forests in solid masses of green, now darkening
in the twilight. And beyond, far, far beyond, the
Park they had left lay bright under the sun&rsquo;s after-glow,
with a background of range on range of mountains in
their violet haze. On the shelf was forage for the
horses; near at hand were moss and balsam for their
beds; and at a little distance a rivulet, ice-cold, had
shady pools where small trout awaited capture. And
the air was like dry wine on the lips, with a tang of
resin in the nostrils; and the woods sang a song that
even Marion could not resist.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>Here they pitched two tents just large enough to
cover the beds of balsam boughs and moss and blankets.
In the three days they passed in camp Marion learned
many things that were to be of incalculable value to her
one day, though she never could have guessed that all
this too, like the encounter in the Forbidden Pasture,
had been ordered in the Beginning, details in the
Scheme of Things. She learned surprising secrets of
makeshift cookery; she learned the Indian&rsquo;s lesson of a
very little fire; she learned the mountaineer&rsquo;s economy
of matches and like precious articles. She fished in the
small pools that lay hidden away in dark recesses of the
forest, practised shooting with her rifle, and on the third
day, in the timber below the camp, with Seth at her
side, brought down her first deer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you!&rdquo; cried Huntington, delighted at the
progress of his pupil.</p>
<p>But her heart was not in all this; it was clamoring
now to be heard, and would by no means be stilled.
Each evening Marion walked apart from the others, to
stand at the edge of the lofty platform, and watch her
green and violet Elysium swallowed up in night. Each
morning she searched for it through her field glasses to
assure herself that it had not vanished in the dark.
And when the last day of their outing came, the last
evening, the last night, she could scarce contain her impatience.
To-morrow they would start; and the day
after&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She could not sleep that night. Every twig and
every needle of her pine mattress seemed to have conspired
to torture her. She tossed about until she could
no longer endure her bed; and in the middle of the night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
she crept out of the tent, and sat, wrapped in a blanket,
before the smouldering embers of the fire. The hobbled
horses grazed not far away; a night bird twitted solitarily
in the brush; and from the depths of the forest
came the scream of some savage creature out on its kill.
Against the star-crowded sky the peaks stood up cold
and impassive. What cared they? What did the
world care? What did Philip care?</p>
<p>For now she knew that she loved him. Yes, yes, she
loved him! In her heart she had known it from the
beginning, since that meeting in the Forbidden Pasture,
had known it as one knows things without acknowledgment.
Her mind had acknowledged only the hundred
reasons why she should not, could not love him. He
had repelled her; he had not veiled his meaning, had not
concealed his antagonism; he had told her plainly, brutally
almost, that he would not endure her presence, that
she must avoid his side of the Park.</p>
<p>Then she thought of Robert,&ndash;&ndash;Robert, so devoted
and so true. What was she doing: throwing away his
love that was so unselfishly, so whole-heartedly laid at
her feet? Had she been mad to flee from him? Yes,
mad! Pride rose to support the fondness and the admiration
she had felt for him. And so there ensued a
struggle between the two fine spirits that dwelt in her,&ndash;&ndash;the
proud little lady of the Fragonard and the Viking
with red hair.</p>
<p>The Viking won. Had not her father said to her,
in those long talks about her mother, that love is the
only thing? And back she came, on swiftest wings of
passion, to Philip; and she was glad. She knew now
the meaning of her restlessness in the dark days in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
unheeding city; she knew whose voice had called, whose
arms had held her, though he was unaware. He needed
her, though he did not know it. And she had come to
him, without understanding. Somewhere she had read
a fugitive bit of verse that had meant nothing then, and
had been forgotten until now, when it suddenly sang
across the years and the spaces like a call to courage:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The wild wind bloweth<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>The cross of fire.<br />
The wild heart knoweth<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Its own desire.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The wild heart knoweth its own desire! She rose to
her feet with a singing and a resurrection of her heart.
She scarcely knew that her limbs were stiff and that her
body ached with cold. Her spirit was aroused. She
could not go and take Philip as her father had taken the
one he loved. But there were ways; when had a woman
ever failed, in love, of finding them? She set herself
to thinking, planning, scheming, while she walked
swiftly to and fro before the tents. And presently she
stopped her pacing, and looked curiously around her.
There had come a subtle alteration in the aspect of the
night. A shivering freshness had crept insensibly into
the air. Leaves and grass and the very air appeared to
be astir, though the silence and the darkness were as
before. She looked up eagerly at the sky, and saw that
the stars were pale. It was not yet the dawn; it was
only the passing of the night. But the dawn was near.
The dawn! The dawn!</p>
<p>She did not wish Seth to find her there. He would
ask questions, staring at her. She crept stealthily back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
into her tent, and lay there, shaking with cold, to wait
for the noise that Huntington would make as he sought
for live embers in the ashes of the fire.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Once out of the mountains and in the foothills, she
rode far ahead of Seth and Claire, impatient at the slow
progress necessitated by the difficulties of the pack
horses. Late in the afternoon she found herself at a
fork of the road with which she was familiar. A little
way up the less-used of the two branches there was a
glade where columbines grew in extraordinary profusion.
She had gathered armloads of them there, and
seemed scarcely to have touched the edge of that wild
garden where nature had been seized with a prodigal
impulse. And now, rather to be doing something than
to await in irritation for Seth and Claire, she turned
her pony&rsquo;s head and rode toward the glade. In five
minutes she was fording a little stream, beyond which
the road rose slightly to cross the shoulder of a hill, and
dipped again to run in a sharp curve along the margin
of the glade. She took the rise at a gallop, sped down
the other slope, and at the curve of the road reined up
her horse with a startled cry. She had come suddenly
upon a team hitched at the side of the road,&ndash;&ndash;the sorrels
and the trap in which Philip Haig had driven her to
Huntington&rsquo;s that terrible evening.</p>
<p>For a moment she was bereft of thought and feeling.
At that very instant she had been thinking of him; what
instant was she not thinking of him? But the utterly
unexpected encounter&ndash;&ndash;for he was there somewhere, in
the glade, no doubt&ndash;&ndash;swept away all that courage she
had found on Avalanche. She felt suddenly helpless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
inert, afraid; and before she could regain her self-possession,
call back her high resolve, the bushes at the
roadside parted, and Philip stood before her. He bore
a great bouquet of columbines, their stems wrapped in
damp moss and leaves and tied securely with a string.
At sight of her he halted; and that look of annoyance
she had seen him wear in the road below his ranch house
came again into his pale face. For some seconds they
regarded each other in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; he said at length, with a smile that tortured
her, &ldquo;this is not my side of the Ridge. I am the trespasser,
even though this is public domain. You have as
much right here as I&ndash;&ndash;more, since I said the Ridge was
the dividing line. So&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped quickly to her horse&rsquo;s side, pressed the
great bunch of pale-blue flowers into her limp but obedient
hands, lifted his battered hat, turned on his heel,
walked directly to the trap, leaped into the seat, and
drove swiftly away. She watched him dully until he
was out of sight behind a bend in the road, among the
trees; watched the spot where he had disappeared until
it became a blur to her aching eyes. Then she looked
slowly down at the flowers in her hands. Columbines!
Frail, lovely things, the fairest product, she had thought,
of nature&rsquo;s laboratory, reflecting the infinite, ineffable
blue of God&rsquo;s skies, delicate as the flower that had
bloomed with such wonderful, unexpected beauty in her
own heart! How she could have treasured them, wept
over them, hugged them to her breast, if he had given
them to her in another way. Slowly her fingers relaxed.
The flowers fell into the dust of the road. She stared
down, at them a moment; and then, with a cry, leaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
from her horse, picked them up eagerly, clasped them to
her breast, buried her face in them, and watered them
with her tears.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Seth said he guessed he would ride down to the post-office
before supper; yesterday was mail day; might be
something. Marion was glad of his departure, and to
avoid Claire was not difficult, considering what baths,
and changing of linen, and brushing of hair they required
after their outing. Refreshed and rested, they
had scarcely met before the new-lighted fire at twilight
when Seth returned, stamping vigorously into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the lucky one, Marion,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pockets, and finally produced a
letter. She took it, glanced at it, and let it fall into her
lap. A great stillness seemed to have come upon the
world. She appeared to be looking at Seth and Claire
across great distances. She could hear her heart pounding
in her bosom, like something that hammered for
freedom. Ages seemed to have passed before she was
able to rise slowly, to smile, to beg to be excused a
moment. In her room she stood quite still, mechanically
tore open the envelope, and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Marion: You told me not to write, and I have obeyed
till now. Don&rsquo;t scold, please! You see I am in Denver. It&rsquo;s
business. Honest! A mining deal, just for a flyer. It may
mean millions or nothing. I am here for several days, possibly
weeks. Won&rsquo;t you <i>please</i> let me run up to see you?
Don&rsquo;t say no, Marion. I promise to be good. I have an auto
here, and they tell me the roads are O.&nbsp;K. at this season. I&rsquo;ll
come away the minute you tell me to. If I can see you only
for an hour it will make me very happy.</p>
<p class='ralign'>Yours always,<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>Robert</span>.<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>She read it twice, while the color slowly returned to
her cheeks. Then the letter faded from her sight, and
she saw a face that wore a cruel smile, and heard a voice
that bade her begone. And suddenly a wave of resentment,
of anger, swept over her. To have been scorned,
flouted, humiliated by one to whom&ndash;&ndash;And here was
a man who wanted her as he wanted nothing else in the
world, who would toil for her, die for her, who would
treasure every word and smile she should consent to give
him, whose one desire was to make her happy. What
madness had come over her that she&ndash;&ndash;she the Viking&rsquo;s
daughter&ndash;&ndash;Her eyes were drawn, she knew not how,
to the columbines that she had carefully, tenderly arranged
in a bowl on her dressing table. In a passion
she rushed upon them, snatched them up dripping, bore
them to the open window, and flung them with all her
strength out upon the lawn. A moment she stood looking
at them, her hands clutched upon her heaving breast,
her whole body quivering with the storm that raged
within her. Then she whirled around, flung herself
down at her little writing table, and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Robert: Yes, come. <span class='smcap'>Marion.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her hand trembled now so that she could scarcely address
the envelope, and seal it. But it was done at last.
She rose, and paused a moment to collect herself. Her
mouth was dry, her forehead was hot under the hand
that she pressed upon it. Nervously she poured a glass
of water from the crystal pitcher that stood on a little
table by the window, and gulped it down. Her eyes,
as she did so, fell again upon the bouquet of columbines
lying forlorn, their tender faces half buried in the dry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
grass. A cry rose to her lips, but she forced it back,
and with a tightening of her lips, turned and went rapidly
out into the room where Seth and Claire awaited
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she cried, in a voice that
sounded strangely shrill and unmusical in her ears.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Robert&ndash;&ndash;Robert Hillyer&ndash;&ndash;Papa&rsquo;s good
friend&ndash;&ndash;and mine. He wants to come up and see me&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
in Denver&ndash;&ndash;on business. He wants to come up&ndash;&ndash;he
says&ndash;&ndash;just for a day or two&ndash;&ndash;do you mind&ndash;&ndash;if
I ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, dear!&rdquo; cried Claire, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; seconded Seth. &ldquo;Tell him he&rsquo;s very welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d say that!&rdquo; said Marion excitedly.
&ldquo;So&ndash;&ndash;the letter&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s all ready. Can it go out&ndash;&ndash;the
stage goes to-morrow, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Huntington. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it down in
the morning&ndash;&ndash;before you&rsquo;re up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood a moment, smiling at them. Then her eyes
wandered aimlessly around the room. She must do
something quick, or she would go to pieces. She saw
the piano, and fairly ran to it. Crash! went the chords.
Rippling and tumbling on one another came the notes
under her nervous fingers. Out of the jumble of unrelated
sounds presently emerged a gay and sparkling
melody; and then a gayer one; and after that a rollicking
song from one of the latest musical comedies.
There followed two of the sauciest, most irresponsible
tunes that ever made a vaudeville success. She played
with abandon, a kind of reckless fury, sitting erect, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
her head flung back, an insouciant smile flickering about
her lips, her lithe body swaying with the music. Then
suddenly, in the midst of a tune, she stopped, arose,
faced Seth and Claire with flaming cheeks and eyes
unnaturally bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great, Marion!&rdquo; cried Seth, slapping his thigh.
&ldquo;Go on, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Claire had seen what Huntington had not. She
turned to him swiftly, with a quick command, as if she
had suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve clean forgot that pie, Seth. Go to the cave and
bring me some apples. Quick, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sensed something a little queer in that order,
which would have been very natural and pleasing at any
other time, but he did not stop to question. Claire
waited until the door had closed behind him, then ran
to Marion, with anxiety pictured in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Marion?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Claire, Claire!&rdquo; cried Marion, breaking.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;unhappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she flung herself into Claire&rsquo;s arms, weeping
without restraint.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>SUNNYSIDES</h3>
</div>
<p>Marion was not alone in her misery; but knowledge
of this, had it by any chance come to her,
would not have eased her heart, though it might indeed
have hardened it a little against more suffering to come.</p>
<p>Toward bedtime of the eighth day after that encounter
at the glade of the columbines, Philip Haig sat
stiffly silent in his armchair, staring into the fire. His
brow was dark with discontent, his cheeks had paled
with the slow ebbing of the tide of passion that had
swept over him. It had begun to rise, though he was
not then aware of it, or barely aware of it, the day
Marion had halted him in the road below his ranch
house; it had reached its flood as he drove away from
her and left the bouquet of columbines in her limp
hands.</p>
<p>Who was this girl? And why had she come to torture
him? To him she now appeared as the incarnation
of his tragedy. In her the Past, from which he had
fled to the far corners of the earth, hiding his trail in
seas and deserts and in stagnant backwaters of humanity,
had tracked him down at last. And all the grief
and bitterness and hatred that he had beaten down, or
thought he had beaten down, had returned to rend and
tear him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>Two beings he had loved, and to them he had given,
to each in a different way, all his heart and soul and
mind: his father and&ndash;&ndash;that other. She had come to
him at his most susceptible age, when, devoted only to
art, he knew nothing of the world&ndash;&ndash;a green boy, the
wise ones had called him. She had come to him with
all the surprise and wonder of a revelation, a coronation,
a fulfillment, a golden epiphany. He had attributed to
her such spiritual perfections as should have gone with
her beauty and her grace; worshipped her for all that
she was not and all that he was himself. And she had
deceived him, exploited him, plundered him,&ndash;&ndash;and
laughed at him when by chance, one tragic, intolerable
night, he found her out. And the next morning, as if
his cup were not already full, he had received a cablegram,
in his attic studio in Paris, telling him that his
father had killed himself in a moment of despair over
financial difficulties. So he had killed his father with
his excessive demands for money to squander on &rsquo;Tonite.
To be sure, he did not know&ndash;&ndash;had had no hint from
home&ndash;&ndash;had never guessed that his father was in
trouble. Nevertheless he had killed him&ndash;&ndash;rather, she
had killed him. What a fool he had been! Never
such another fool since God placed man and woman
together in one world. Cursing himself and her, and
in her cursing all her sex, he fled&ndash;&ndash;he knew not where.
So stunned and dazed he was that he never really came
to himself, found himself, until one day he awoke in
Hong Kong.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the new life, if such it
might be called. He became a wanderer, an adventurer,
seeking always new faces, new places, new experiences,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
trying always to forget, hoping always for a blessed
knock on the head in some mad undertaking, for a thin
knife in the back in some wild adventure. But in all
his wanderings the one kind of adventure that he refused,
the one excitement that he steadfastly shunned,
was the one that, because of his very aloofness, and of
something that women ever saw in his eyes, was offered
to him the most freely, in every land beneath the sun.</p>
<p>Slim Jim entered, bringing whisky and hot water.
Haig turned his head to look at him. Jim never
changed, whatever his environment; he was always the
Orient, the inscrutable East. And now, slipping in so
stealthily, he seemed to bring with him an atmosphere,
an odor, a call, and Haig, still looking at Jim, but
scarcely seeing him, began to murmur lines that intoxicated
him:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;I know not where the white road runs, nor what the blue hills are,<br />
But man can have the sun for friend, and for his guide a star;<br />
And there&rsquo;s no end of voyaging when once the voice is heard,<br />
For the river calls and the road calls, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>He stopped and sat suddenly erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do you remember the night we
took old Kwang&rsquo;s girl away from the river rats in Tien-Tsin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vellee well,&rdquo; answered the Chinaman.</p>
<p>His face was expressionless; he concealed the joy that
this mood of his master aroused in his thin breast. Jim
did not like the Park, and only the recollection of one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
day when he had stood tied to a capstan on a pirate
junk, with a dozen fiends around him trying to make
him tell something he did not know, and Haig had
suddenly descended upon them like the foreign devil
he was,&ndash;&ndash;well, Jim took his gods where he found them,
and from that day Haig had never been able to rid himself
of this idolater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tien-Tsin! Tien-Tsin!&rdquo; Haig repeated, lingering
covetously on the words. &ldquo;But that was a fight, eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No likee!&rdquo; replied Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No likee!&rdquo; cried Haig. &ldquo;Why, you hypocritical
young ruffian, you! That was one of the happiest
nights of your life. You&rsquo;re always trying to make people
think you&rsquo;re asleep, or timid. I can see, right now,
that long knife of yours slip under my arm, and catch
the big fellow in the stomach. He just coughed once,
and crumpled up at my feet. In the nick of time, too,
Jim, and I let the next one have it. The rest of them
took to their heels, and you with your long pigsticker
after them. No likee! Jim, you&rsquo;re a moon-faced old
liar, and a disgrace to your ten thousand and seven ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s smile was perfectly noncommittal. He was
too wily to appear eager. Besides, he did not really
like fighting, which made all the more trouble for somebody
when he had to fight. But he was heartily sick of
this cold and uneventful life in the Park. Better a
thousand times the foolish adventures, the unnecessary
battles, the restless wanderings of other days!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a night!&rdquo; said Haig, flinging himself back
in his chair to gaze dreamily into the flames, while Jim,
like a blue ghost, stole noiselessly away. And there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
in the glow of the dying fire, bright and alluring visions
successively took shape: A red-and-yellow temple on
a hill, to which a thousand steps led up from a lake the
color of a blue heron&rsquo;s breast; a junk with sails of
purple creeping out of a morning mist as yellow as saffron;
an island with a still lagoon in its center, and
coconut palms alive with screaming parrots of every
gorgeous hue; a sandy beach where jabbering natives
dragged the flotsam of a wrecked steamer out of the
breakers; a village on a high plateau, where a drum
throbbed incessantly, and naked Indian children peered
out from behind the huts; a skirmish line in khaki
crawling up to the brow of a shell-swept hill; a dog-team
yelping under the long lash of a half-breed Aleut,
on a frozen river that sparkled in the sun; a sweating
jungle where two bright spots glowed balefully in the
gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; groaned Haig, as he sat erect at last, and
reached for the glass, now cold. He tasted it, and set
it back with a wry face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn Thursby!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Does he think
I&rsquo;m going to stay here forever, like a bear in a pit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He woke the next morning in an ugly humor, having
slept little, and then only to dream such dreams as
fed his discontent. He berated Jim because the biscuits
were cold (which was not Jim&rsquo;s fault), and because
the coffee was hot (which was according to his
orders). Trivial annoyances, most of them of his own
making or imagining, multiplied on all sides, fomenting
his irritability until, by the time he strode out of the
cottage, his temper was at white heat. What might
have happened to the patient, devoted men about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
stable and corrals is not difficult of conjecture, but they
were saved by Sunnysides. Almost the first object that
caught Haig&rsquo;s eye was the yellow outlaw gleaming in
the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>His inner turmoil of these last few days had banished
all thought of the stallion of the San Luis. But now,
his eyes gleamed as he quickened his steps toward the
stable.</p>
<p>Farrish and Pete were at work among the stalls; Bill
stood guard over Sunnysides; and the fourth man,
Curly, was mending a saddle in the harness-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farrish!&rdquo; Haig called out, striding into the stable.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tackle the yellow fellow this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farrish and Pete turned, and looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; answered Farrish; and then added
doubtfully: &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farrish, in a manner that showed a certain reluctance,
put up the currycomb with which he had been grooming
the sorrels, and started toward the rear door. But Pete
stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too, Pete!&rdquo; said Haig, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you better not&ndash;&ndash;to-day,&rdquo; answered the Indian,
in his slow way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; snapped Haig.</p>
<p>Pete had seen the expression on Haig&rsquo;s face, and did
not like it. But he hesitated to utter what was in his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; repeated Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you better wait,&rdquo; was all that Pete could
say.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; cried Haig. &ldquo;Get your lariat! And be
quick about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had read Pete&rsquo;s thought; his ill-humor had evidently
shown itself in his face; but the caution only
whetted his purpose. Throwing off his coat as he went,
he passed through the rear door of the barn, and climbed
into the outlaw&rsquo;s corral, followed by Farrish, Curly,
and Pete.</p>
<p>Sunnysides received them with suspicion. His head
was high, his nostrils were dilated, his tail swished
slowly, like a tiger&rsquo;s. One forefoot was raised a little,
resting on the toe, and the muscles of his shoulders
quivered under the glossy hide. He had fully recovered
from the effects of his rough treatment on the road, and
his skin shone with a satin-like luster in the morning
sun.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, while Haig and the
others looked at the horse, and he at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Farrish! Pete!&rdquo; commanded Haig.</p>
<p>And the battle began. Farrish and Pete turn by
turn flung their lariats at the horse&rsquo;s head and feet, but
time after time he dodged, and ducked, and capered
away from the whirling noose, or wriggled out of the
coil as it tightened around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s greased lightning!&rdquo; ejaculated Bill, from his
perch on the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hell, that&rsquo;s what he is!&rdquo; retorted Curly, from
a corner of the corral.</p>
<p>Farrish and Pete went silently on with their work.
They knew that eventually, dance and squirm as he
might, the horse would be caught in one or the other of
the relentless loops. And so it proved. While Sunnysides
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
was side-stepping a throw by Farrish, Pete&rsquo;s rope
slipped snakily over his head, and tightened around the
arched neck. With an artful lunge toward the Indian,
and a lowering of his head, the horse struggled to throw
off the coil. But it held.</p>
<p>Then followed a mad performance. The horse was
over all the corral at once, it seemed: rearing, plunging,
leaping, tossing his head, crashing into the fence with
such fury that it barely stood up under his onslaughts.
Bill was knocked off the fence backward on to his head;
Curly, crowded into his corner, barely avoided a vicious
kick; and Haig&rsquo;s temper was not improved by the narrow
escape he had from being crushed against a post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Get a rope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man ran into the barn, returned with a lariat, and
joined the fray. Plainly chagrined, though unhurt by
his fall, Bill took long chances to even up the score;
and under the very hoofs of the infuriated animal, he
made a throw that brought Sunnysides sprawling on the
ground, his forefeet caught in Bill&rsquo;s noose. It was the
work of a few seconds then for Farrish to secure the hind
feet also; and the horse lay prostrate, panting and half-choked,
but defiant still.</p>
<p>Giving him no time to recover, and no more breath
than he actually required, Haig and Curly forced the
bit of a bridle into the outlaw&rsquo;s foaming mouth. Then
the noose on his hind feet was cautiously removed, one
forefoot was freed, and the horse was allowed to rise.
The next proceeding appeared to be resented by Sunnysides
even more than what he had already been subjected
to. While Farrish and Pete held his head, Haig approached
him cautiously with a saddle, and dropped it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
on his back. There was a lightning-like motion, and
the saddle was tossed a dozen feet away, while the two
men at the horse&rsquo;s head were jerked almost off their
feet. Again and again the saddle was laid on his back,
to remain there barely an instant. But at the fifth attempt,
to the astonishment of all, Sunnysides stood still,
as if, being an equine Napoleon, he had changed his
plan of battle in the face of the enemy. Without
further resistance, he permitted the saddle to be adjusted
and cinched, permitted the men to lead him out
of the corral into the larger one adjoining it, and permitted
Haig to mount him and take the bridle reins in
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; said Curly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried Farrish. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; ordered Haig, pointing to the rope that
still held one forefoot.</p>
<p>The rope was removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pete and Farrish slipped off the lariat that remained
noosed around the outlaw&rsquo;s neck, and stepped back.</p>
<p>For some seconds there was no sound, no motion, no
sign of any design on the part of Sunnysides. Then,
with the swiftness and surprise of a flash of powder in
the dark, a shocking thing occurred. Without a preliminary
movement, either of lunging or bucking or leaping
to one side, or any of the expected tactics, Sunnysides,
with incredible suddenness, reared straight up into
the air, threw himself over, and fell on his back, pinning
Haig to the ground beneath him.</p>
<p>Before any of the men could move, the horse rolled
over sprawling, scrambled to his feet, and charged at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
the fence. There was a crash and the sound of splintering
wood. The top plank fell, broken in two jagged
pieces, and the horse&rsquo;s forefeet were over the second
plank. But before he could leap again, Curley had
caught the bridle rein, and swung the outlaw&rsquo;s head
around, holding him there until Bill had leaned over
the broken fence and roped the forelegs once more.
After a moment of furious struggle, Sunnysides appeared
to realize that it was useless; and thus the two
men held him, with his forefeet still hanging outside
the fence, while they turned their eyes toward Haig.</p>
<p>Farrish and the Indian knelt at his side. He lay
quite still, unconscious, and for a moment they thought
him dead. Pete put his head down on Haig&rsquo;s breast,
and listened. Then he rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisky!&rdquo; he muttered, and ran toward the stable.</p>
<p>In two minutes he was back, bearing a flask, which he
uncorked as he ran. Forcing the mouth of it between
Haig&rsquo;s lips, he let the scorching liquor trickle down the
throat until the flask was half emptied. Then he poured
some of the whisky in the palm of his hand, and rubbed
it on Haig&rsquo;s face and bared breast and wrists, while
Farrish, in his turn, ran to the stable and brought a
lap robe, which he folded and placed under Haig&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>They waited helplessly, without speech. At the
fence, Bill and Curley clung to their ropes. Sunnysides,
his forefeet still projecting over the plank, and
the saddle hanging lopsided from his back, had his
head drawn back so far that he could see the group in
the middle of the corral. His eyes were bloodshot,
foam dripped from his mouth, the breath came whistling
through his half-shut windpipe.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>But in the cottonwoods the birds sang undisturbed,
and the pines far up the hill droned their old tune unchanged.
From the ranch house came the rattle of tin
pans, and the voice of the cook singing a song of the
round-up.</p>
<p>After a long time, Haig stirred. A moan came with
the first deep breath; his eyes opened, staring up at the
two faces above him; his lips moved, but at first no
sound came from them. Pete leaned closer, and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;get&ndash;&ndash;away?&rdquo; came in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Pete. &ldquo;He caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile flickered on Haig&rsquo;s lips, and went out; and at
the same time a tiny trickle of blood oozed out, and
ran down through the dust on the white cheek. Pete
and Farrish looked at each other; and when they turned
to Haig again, his eyes were closed, and the pallor of
his face had deepened to a bluish, ashen hue.</p>
<p>Pete bent quickly to put his ear again to Haig&rsquo;s
breast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>HILLYER&rsquo;S DILEMMA</h3>
</div>
<p>Hillyer&rsquo;s loyal heart was near to bursting with
joy. In all the days of his eager courtship
Marion had never seemed so close to him, so fairly
within his grasp, as now. She had welcomed him with
totally unexpected warmth, considering the many times
she had rejected him, and considering, too, the letter he
had received from her on her departure. Absence, he
thought, had advanced his cause for him. A dozen
times he was on the point of boldly violating the six
months&rsquo; embargo she had placed upon his pleadings;
but as often as the fervent words rose to his lips fear
froze them there, and he was silent.</p>
<p>As for Marion, she was for the moment absorbed in
a little plan that was not for Robert&rsquo;s knowledge. She
was intent upon meeting Philip in Robert&rsquo;s company;
she wanted to bow to him, and smile, and let him see
that there was one man at least who prized her, if he
did not. But the imp of perversity seemed to have
come to abide permanently in the Park. Though
Marion, in the first two days of Robert&rsquo;s visit, guided
him, in the big automobile, everywhere except beyond
the Ridge and to the glade of the columbines, she had
never a glimpse of Philip. All this maddened her; and
if Robert had but spoken, there were times when&ndash;&ndash;But
Robert did not speak.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>Near noon of the third day they met Smythe in the
main valley road a mile or so below the post-office. At
sight of him bobbing along toward them, almost lost between
his horse and his sombrero, Marion&rsquo;s first impulse
was to speed past him without stopping. She was not
sure she could trust his discretion; for she had told
Robert nothing about Philip Haig. But she did not
wish to offend the faithful Smythe; and so, on second
thought, she hurriedly acquainted Robert with the identity
of the approaching figure, and warned him to control
his inevitable mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is funny,&rdquo; she said, laughing in spite of herself,
&ldquo;but he can&rsquo;t help that. He&rsquo;s been very good to
me, in his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Smythe&rsquo;s horse was deciding the
matter on his own account. This was the first automobile
the pony had ever seen, and he made up his mind
promptly that he did not like it. He reared and bucked,
bolting first to one side and the other of the road, and
refused to consider Smythe&rsquo;s well-worded assurance that
wise horses were really fond of automobiles, which were
taking a great deal of work off their shoulders.</p>
<p>Hillyer stopped the machine, and cut off the power.
But the pony&rsquo;s suspicions had been thoroughly aroused,
and the sudden silence seemed to him more portentous
than even the noise of the motor. Smythe thereupon
had his work cut out for him, but he would not compromise
either by dismounting, or by turning and riding
away. Slowly and patiently he urged the frightened
pony toward the automobile until, after many setbacks
and panics, he had brought him near enough for
conversation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Peanuts!&rdquo; he said to the prancing
animal. &ldquo;You see you were quite mistaken.&rdquo; Then,
to Hillyer and Marion: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little like myself.
He doesn&rsquo;t really believe in ghosts, but he&rsquo;s dreadfully
afraid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were such an accomplished horseman,&rdquo;
said Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you? Well, you see&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant the pony suffered a fresh access of
alarm. He bounded suddenly sideways, and at the
same time ducked as if he purposed to stand on his
head, though what good that would have done only he
knew. The movement threw Smythe over the pony&rsquo;s
head, and flat on his back in the dust; and in a twinkling
Peanuts was dashing up the road, with his tail in
the air, and the stirrups flapping at his sides.</p>
<p>For some seconds Smythe lay half-stunned; but before
Marion and Hillyer, leaping from the automobile,
were able to reach him, he sat up, and began to straighten
out his crushed sombrero, eyeing it critically. He was
covered with dust, and one end of his white collar, torn
from the button, stuck out above his coat. But his
aplomb was perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying, when interrupted,&rdquo; he began, continuing
to minister to the sombrero, &ldquo;you see I am an
accomplished horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion and Hillyer broke out in uncontrollable laughter.
Then Hillyer hastened to assist Smythe to
rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hurt, I hope?&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Objectively, no. Subjectively, yes. Sartorially, a
wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>They laughed now without restraint, which seemed
to please Smythe immensely. He proceeded to tuck
the end of the torn collar back into its place, where it
refused to stay; to brush his clothes; to adjust the
abused sombrero in exactly the long-studied angle on his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive us for laughing,&rdquo; said Marion,
&ldquo;but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more about it, please!&rdquo; protested Smythe.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather make you laugh than weep&ndash;&ndash;assuming that
anybody would weep for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d have felt very badly if you&rsquo;d been hurt,&rdquo;
Marion assured him. &ldquo;And you might have been,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a cropper like that&rsquo;s nothing. Peanuts
isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He paused just a second to look into Marion&rsquo;s
eyes with an expression that arrested her attention
sharply. &ldquo;Peanuts isn&rsquo;t Sunnysides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunnysides?&rdquo; she cried out unguardedly.</p>
<p>Smythe&rsquo;s eyes warned her, as he waited to give her
time for self-control. He did not know how far Hillyer
was in her confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there news&ndash;&ndash;about&ndash;&ndash;Sunnysides?&rdquo; she faltered,
struggling desperately with herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. Then he continued slowly, in
as light a manner as possible, the while he held her with
a concentrated gaze: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been down the valley as far
as the mouth of the canyon. Coming back, about two
miles below where Haig&rsquo;s road joins this, I saw the
sorrels in a cloud of dust. &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Something&rsquo;s
up, or the sorrels wouldn&rsquo;t be driven like that.&rsquo;
In a minute or two I made out Bill Craven, one of Haig&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
men, leaning forward in the seat of a road wagon, and
laying on the whip. &lsquo;If Haig saw that!&rsquo; I thought.
And so I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, please!&rdquo; said Marion shrilly.</p>
<p>But Smythe was purposely deliberate; for he saw
Hillyer looking at her curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to let anybody abuse his horses if I
could prevent it. Besides, how did I know but Craven
was stealing the sorrels? I threw my pony straight
across the road. Craven reined the sorrels up on their
hind legs, almost on top of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What in hell?&rsquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m in a hurry, damn you?&rsquo; he
shouted angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I do see,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;But
Haig never whips those horses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business, and Haig ain&rsquo;t carin&rsquo;
much now,&rsquo; he fired back at me. &lsquo;Get out o&rsquo; my way, or
I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now just keep cool!&rsquo; I told him. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the
trouble?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craven snorted, but he told me, as the quickest way
out of it. Haig had been hurt&ndash;&ndash;trying to ride Sunnysides.
He&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt? How?&rdquo; asked Marion; and Smythe was
relieved to detect a new steadiness in her voice. She
had passed the danger point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse went over backwards, pinning him to the
ground, with the saddle horn in his stomach. Craven&rsquo;s
gone for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him one long, searching look, as if to pluck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
out anything he might have been hiding from her.
Then she turned swiftly toward the automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Robert! Quick!&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>She climbed quickly into the machine, followed by
Hillyer, who was puzzled and alarmed by what he had
seen in Marion&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too, Mr. Smythe. Hurry!&rdquo; cried Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my horse?&rdquo; objected Smythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll run home,&rdquo; answered Marion impatiently.
&ldquo;Come! We may need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smythe obeyed, and jumped into the tonneau, while
Robert cranked up and threw in the clutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast!&rdquo; cried Marion.</p>
<p>Hillyer glanced at her. She was very white; her
lips were pressed together, her eyes were fixed on the
road ahead. The machine lurched under them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; urged Marion, in another minute.</p>
<p>The machine, with a kind of shudder, responded to
Hillyer&rsquo;s hand, and shot out with fresh speed.</p>
<p>Another brief silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cut-out!&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<p>Hillyer bent to the mechanism, and the engine, with
the muffler off, roared and shrieked as it took the smooth
white road, with every bar and rivet throbbing under the
pressure. Only then did Marion turn, and motion to
Smythe. He leaned forward, clinging to the back of
her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor?&rdquo; she shouted in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craven had started for Tellurium,&rdquo; he yelled back.
&ldquo;Said he&rsquo;d kill the sorrels. I told him there was a
doctor at Lake Cobalt&ndash;&ndash;Doctor Norris of Omaha&ndash;&ndash;just
arrived, with his family. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not such a fool
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
after all,&rsquo; said Craven. (I&rsquo;ll talk with him about that
later.) &lsquo;Thanks!&rsquo; I said, and pulled my horse out of
the way. &lsquo;That saves two days.&rsquo; He gave the horses
the whip again, and I started for Huntington&rsquo;s to tell
you&ndash;&ndash;Watch out! There&rsquo;s the turn!&rdquo; he shouted in
Hillyer&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>The wheels tore up the sand as the machine, with
the power off but still going at more than half-speed under
its momentum, skidded and scraped around the turn
into Haig&rsquo;s road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; cried Marion.</p>
<p>Again the automobile shivered, and plunged, and went
clamoring like a mad thing up the little valley, the hills
echoing back its roar. The white road leaped up at
them, gulping them in. A red steer, astray from some
pasture, crossed the road far ahead of them, and Marion
closed her eyes as the machine, with a sickening swerve,
missed it by inches. The next instant she was pointing
to the group of buildings squatting under the hill; and
then she was out of the automobile, and running to Farrish
at the door of the barn. His face confirmed her
worst fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she asked, with a swift look around.</p>
<p>He pointed toward the larger of the two cottages.
With Hillyer and Smythe silently following, she ran
to the cottage, and through the open door. There she
found herself in a bare, uncarpeted room, furnished
only with two chairs and a table. On the table lay a
faded and battered gray hat. For an instant her gaze
rested on it, and a lump rose in her throat. But she
resolutely turned away, tightening her lips.</p>
<p>There were two inner doors, one of which, ajar, revealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
a glimpse of brightly polished pans hanging on
the wall. The other door was closed. After an instant
of hesitation, she walked straight toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; called Hillyer warningly.</p>
<p>She did not heed him, but turned the knob, softly
opened the door, and with Robert and Smythe at her
heels, stepped into a dimly lighted room where the
aroma of a pine log blazing in the fireplace mingled
with the pungent odor of ammonia. Smythe was quick
to observe, over Marion&rsquo;s shoulder, that the room was a
sort of library and bedroom combined, carpeted in dark
red, the walls papered in red also, and the windows curtained
with heavy tapestry silk of the same rich hue.
There were low bookcases on two sides of the room,
with pictures above them; several marble statuettes on
the bookcases; and a little jade Buddha beside a two-foot
bronze god of terrifying aspect on the mantelpiece.
In the middle of the apartment stood a solid library
table, of which the cover was a curious strip of faded
yellow silk embroidered with a dragon in green, a fragment
of an old Chinese banner.</p>
<p>At the left of the door, its head against the wall, was
a brass bed in which a figure moved restlessly under the
covers. Near the head of the bed, on the side nearest
the door, stood the Indian, his stolid, bronzed face
turned toward Marion as she entered. On the other
side, holding one of Haig&rsquo;s hands, knelt Slim Jim in his
blue silks, his yellowish face as expressionless as Pete&rsquo;s,
except for an alert and questioning look in his eyes.
There was no sound except the low crackling of the fire,
and the rasp of heavy breathing, with sharp catches in it
that spoke eloquently of pain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>Marion stepped to Pete&rsquo;s side, and looked down into
the face of Philip Haig. In the dim light it had the
pallor of death, with the parted lips and the staring
eyes of the dead, or the dying. But he breathed; and
presently her steady, searching, pitying gaze brought his
eyes to meet her own, and she saw that they were living
eyes, though clouded and darkened with agony. Almost
was she on her knees, weeping over him, regardless
of those in the doorway watching her. And it was not
their presence so much as the necessity for action that
restrained and steadied her. She did not even speak his
name; but after her one long look, she turned away, and
with every outward sign of calm, removed her gloves
and hat and coat, and placed them on a chair in a
corner of the room. Then she beckoned to Pete, who
followed her, with Smythe and Hillyer, into the bare
outer room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the door, please!&rdquo; she commanded quietly.</p>
<p>Smythe closed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he hurt?&rdquo; she asked the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; He laid a hand on his stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he unconscious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has he been like that&ndash;&ndash;awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done? What have you given him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water. Ammonia on face and breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. From mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had another struggle then, and the tears started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
in spite of all that she could do. But she conquered
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Little, only at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pete.&rdquo; Then, turning to Hillyer: &ldquo;I
want you, Robert, please, to drive home, and tell Mrs.
Huntington to make up a bundle of the things I shall
need. Wait! A pencil and a bit of paper, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he did not move to comply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Marion?&rdquo; he asked, his
voice shaking slightly with the effort of speaking calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to nurse him,&rdquo; she replied, meeting his
look without flinching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marion! I don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pencil and paper, Robert!&rdquo; she said firmly.</p>
<p>He tore a leaf from a notebook, and gave it to her
with his pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said; and seated herself at the
table to write.</p>
<p>But there was the dilapidated hat again&ndash;&ndash;so stained
and soiled, a crumpled, tragic, intimate thing&ndash;&ndash;arresting
her. How it had filled her dreams! How she
had laughed at it, fondly, tenderly, as a mother smiles
at the battered school hat of her boy! Once, she had
fancied it hanging on the pink wall in her room, a
trophy, with a ribbon tied around its sweated band.
And now she wanted to grab it up, and hug it to her
breast. But she only lifted it gently, and placed it a
little farther away, on the other side of the table. Then
she made her notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Robert!&rdquo; she said, rising, and handing the
list to him. &ldquo;Claire will know where to find them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>He took the paper mechanically, his eyes fixed on
Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come down, to the car for a moment?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>She saw the look, and softened under it. But she
could not answer his questions then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Later, if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he hesitated. But he could say no
more in the presence of Smythe and Pete, though they
were talking together at the other side of the room. So
he moved slowly away, but was suddenly stopped by a
cry from Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t somebody&ndash;&ndash;why
didn&rsquo;t I think of it before? The car?
Run, Robert! Drive down the road toward the lake.
You&rsquo;ll overtake the sorrels&ndash;&ndash;or meet them. Bring the
doctor in the car. Fast, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillyer, without another word, ran and leaped into
the automobile, and was soon bringing the echoes out
of the hills again. He sank low in the seat, and fixed
his eyes on the road that stretched out blinding white in
the sunlight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>COALS OF FIRE</h3>
</div>
<p>Seth was oiling a pair of boots on the veranda,
while Claire talked to him about Hillyer, who had
pleased her immeasurably by his devotion to Marion,
and even more, of course, by his generous compliments
to herself. She was delicately calling Seth&rsquo;s attention
to the pleasure, the profits, and the sanctity of politeness,
when she caught sight of Hillyer&rsquo;s automobile
emerging slowly and silently from the trees that concealed
the road at a little distance from the corrals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now!&rdquo; she exclaimed. And then, an
instant later: &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up excitedly, and Seth also, dropping a
half-oiled boot on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil?&rdquo; ejaculated Huntington.</p>
<p>So they stood, waiting and wondering, while Hillyer
alighted from the automobile, and walked, with exasperating
slowness&ndash;&ndash;with reluctance, if they had but known
it&ndash;&ndash;up the graveled path among the flower beds.
Something in the look of him caused Claire to clutch a
post of the veranda for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Marion?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied Hillyer, as he mounted the
steps. &ldquo;That is, nothing has happened to her. But
there&rsquo;s been an accident.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;Who is
this Philip Haig?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Haig? What about Haig?&rdquo; demanded Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been hurt. A horse threw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunnysides?&rdquo; cried Huntington excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, will he?&rdquo; chuckled Huntington. &ldquo;That
serves&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Marion?&rdquo; interrupted Claire. &ldquo;What about
Marion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillyer looked doubtfully from one to the other, in
much embarrassment. What did they know? Or were
they as ignorant as he of the situation that had been
revealed to him as if by the flash of a thunderbolt?
And how much should he disclose to them, in loyalty to
Marion? But in his pocket was Marion&rsquo;s list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s there&ndash;&ndash;with him,&rdquo; he said at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There? Where?&rdquo; thundered Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood stock-still, staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wishes Mrs. Huntington to make up a bundle
of these things for me to take to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the list to Claire, who took it, and held it
at arm&rsquo;s length, regarding it curiously, as if she had
not understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began, and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she&rsquo;s going to nurse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo; Claire&rsquo;s voice rose almost
to a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve left her there with that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington was going to say &ldquo;ruffian,&rdquo; but was
checked by a sudden recollection, as well as by the look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
that Hillyer flashed at him. For a moment the two
men faced each other, the one with anger boiling up
inside of him, the other struggling to put down the resentment
aroused by Huntington&rsquo;s belligerent tone.
Claire crushed the slip of paper in her hand, and
watched them fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judge from your manner,&rdquo; said Hillyer at length,
when he had controlled himself, &ldquo;that you dislike her
being there as much as I do. But as I am all in the
dark, I&rsquo;ll be greatly obliged to you if you will answer
my question. Who is Philip Haig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo; blurted out Huntington.</p>
<p>Hillyer made a gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s your neighbor,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s about all I know of him,&rdquo; Huntington
replied, &ldquo;except that we ought to have run him out of
the Park long ago, and will do it yet, so help me
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Hillyer shortly.</p>
<p>Then, as clearly as he could in his rage, Seth gave
Hillyer a brief account of the events of the four years
that Haig had been in the Park,&ndash;&ndash;an account that satisfied
Hillyer as little as it had satisfied Marion. He
had meant, in the beginning, to ask how Marion had
come to know Haig, and if they had been much together;
but he now surmised that Huntington and his wife were
as ignorant as himself of that acquaintanceship, or
friendship, or whatever it was that could have made
possible the astounding emotions he had seen on Marion&rsquo;s
face. Hillyer&rsquo;s situation was difficult. If Marion
had a secret he must guard it for her, whatever it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
might cost him. Yet now he needed help, and no one
could help him but Huntington and his wife. And at
the first words on the subject, Huntington had (more in
the tone of his speech than the matter) shown him that
little help could be expected in that quarter. Last of
all, and not to be forgotten, he was the Huntingtons&rsquo;
guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad&rsquo;s he hurt?&rdquo; asked Huntington.</p>
<p>Hillyer shook his head dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to say just yet. Doctor Norris fears
that the pancreas is ruptured. In that case&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He
shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;At any rate, the pancreas
and the stomach are temporarily paralyzed by the blow
of the saddle horn&ndash;&ndash;the horse seems to have gone over
backward on him. If he gets over the shock there&rsquo;s
still the danger of inflammation. There ought to be
ice packs. Cold water will have to do. They must be
changed every minute. Doctor Norris told me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He
paused to look intently at Claire&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Doctor Norris told
me that nothing but the most careful nursing can save
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the Chinaman do it!&rdquo; Huntington blurted out.</p>
<p>Hillyer shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Norris says he will not trust him. You see,
Haig&rsquo;s pleading for water must be denied. He can
command the Chinaman, and that&ndash;&ndash;Besides, all this
is not to the point. Marion has made up her mind, and
I assure you&ndash;&ndash;Please get the things she asks for,
Mrs. Huntington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re going to take them!&rdquo; shouted
Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. She&rsquo;s asked for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to let her stay there&ndash;&ndash;with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillyer smiled. Having abandoned all hope of assistance
from Huntington, he was thinking of other
measures, and was scarcely as attentive as he might have
been to the increasing truculence of his host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d bring her away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care to go and try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a keener thrust than Hillyer had any intention
of delivering, provoked though he was by Huntington&rsquo;s
behavior; for Seth had not included in his narrative
any reference to the affair at the post-office, or to
Haig&rsquo;s visit to his house. Huntington&rsquo;s face became
purple; and if he had been apoplectic in disposition he
would surely have suffered a seizure in that moment of
choking rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there right enough!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,
when I get ready. I&rsquo;ll go when he&rsquo;s able to stand up
and take what&rsquo;s coming to him. As for her&ndash;&ndash;you can
take her things, and her trunks too, while you&rsquo;re about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillyer gazed at him dumbfounded for just a breath
of time. Then his own face flamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Mr. Huntington!&rdquo; he said, taking a
step toward him. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen much of Haig, but
from what I&rsquo;ve seen of you, I think his house can be no
worse place for Miss Gaylord than yours. What&rsquo;s more,
you&rsquo;re an&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He caught himself, whirled on his heel,
and addressed Claire. &ldquo;May I ask you, please, to pack
Marion&rsquo;s trunks. I&rsquo;ll attend to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claire had stood quite silent, with her blue eyes opening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
wider and wider, for the moment helpless, but trusting
more to Hillyer&rsquo;s resources of diplomacy than to her
husband&rsquo;s self-control. Now her face crimsoned with
mortification, and she stood up with all the inches of her
five foot two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing!&rdquo; she cried, and one little
heel came down on the floor with a jolt. &ldquo;The idea!
The very idea! Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she stood poised, like a butterfly in a
rage, if one can imagine it; then she tripped straight to
Huntington, clasped the lapels of his coat, and drew
herself up on tiptoes, trying to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>But he was, or at least was dimly conscious of his
egregious misbehavior; for he looked neither at Hillyer
nor his wife, and was red now where he had been
purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are, though!&rdquo; She turned her face toward
Hillyer, without loosing her hold on Seth&rsquo;s coat.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind him, Mr. Hillyer! He&rsquo;s just a big
bear. And Haig has been a trial to us. Marion&rsquo;s my
guest, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She looked up into Seth&rsquo;s beard
again&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;re going to send her away
like this&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped short, as on a sudden thought, and then,
with a giggle, buried her face in his flannel shirt. And
the next thing, as unexpected as her blue-eyed rage, she
dropped her hands from his coat, stooped to catch up the
hem of her skirt between thumb and forefinger of each
hand, and began to pirouette around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; she exclaimed, laughing triumphantly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
her little body swaying as she tripped, with low curtsies
to Seth and Hillyer, who for the moment forget their
animosity in wonder at this feminine diversion.
&ldquo;Beautiful! Gorgeous! Oh, splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, at length, in front of Seth, dropped to
one knee, bowed till her golden head almost touched the
floor, and rose again to stand with her hands on
her hips, her arms akimbo, her face flushed with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seth Huntington!&rdquo; she cried ecstatically. &ldquo;Do
you know what we&rsquo;re going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He merely stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to heap coals of fire on his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Huntington uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion&rsquo;s going to nurse Haig. There&rsquo;s no way
any of us can stop her. She&rsquo;s our cousin and guest, and
we&rsquo;ve got to show it. If they want to talk, we&rsquo;ll give
them something to talk about. <i>I&rsquo;ll go and nurse Haig
too!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dead silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Hillyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo; roared Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me!&rdquo; retorted Claire, turning swiftly, and
running toward her bedroom. But halfway there she
stopped. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t watch me! You just go and look
after the cattle. Leave this Mr. Haig to us, and he&rsquo;ll
be the best friend you ever had before Marion and I get
through with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillyer, recovering from his amazement, stepped smiling
to where she stood, and reached both his hands to
her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Huntington,&rdquo; he said warmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
peach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed gaily, and put both her tiny hands in
his, for just an instant.</p>
<p>This was the last straw. Seth snorted like a baited
animal, whirled around, bolted from the house, and ran
blindly to the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saddle Nigger!&rdquo; he yelled to Williams, who obeyed
with stumbling alacrity, while Huntington strode up
and down before the door.</p>
<p>From the window of the ranch house Claire and
Hillyer, silent, watched him until he had flung himself
into the saddle, dug the spurs into the flanks of his
favorite and now astonished black horse, and disappeared
up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going?&rdquo; asked Hillyer, suspicious that
Huntington meant mischief.</p>
<p>Claire drew back from the window with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She laughed softly, but with
just a little tremor in her voice&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to&ndash;&ndash;look
after the cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillyer saw that her blue eyes were moist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best man in the world, and&ndash;&ndash;I love him,&rdquo;
she said, looking at Hillyer with a soft appeal. &ldquo;You
believe that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, Mrs. Huntington,&rdquo; Hillyer answered
heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must forgive him; he has such a temper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we had any misunderstanding,&rdquo; Hillyer
was able to say sincerely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk it over with him&ndash;&ndash;later.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; urged Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go now. Those things for Marion,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have them ready in a minute. And I&rsquo;ve only
to slip on another dress, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean&ndash;&ndash;You&rsquo;re not going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am!&rdquo; she answered, with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now think a minute, Mrs. Huntington. Your husband
objects to your going. It will not only anger him
more, but it will hurt him. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted reluctantly.</p>
<p>Her coals of fire had kindled her imagination. Such
a romantic idea! There would be such talk, such a sensation!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be another matter if there were anything
you could do,&rdquo; Hillyer went on. &ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t.
And I know very well that Marion would send you back
if you did go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was true enough, on reflection; but it was a disappointment!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Marion! There alone!&rdquo; she said, making her
last stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be there,&rdquo; replied Hillyer. &ldquo;The Chinaman&rsquo;s
going to fix a bed for me. I&rsquo;ll look after Marion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she yielded, and was glad of it when she had time
to think it over. She gave Hillyer the bundle for Marion,
and watched him go, waving a good-by from the
veranda. Then she hastened to the kitchen to make
apple dumplings for supper. If there was one thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
that could always be counted on to soothe Seth it was
apple dumplings.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meanwhile it was indeed a black day for Huntington.
Fate was against him. Tearing himself, mangled in
spirit, out of one trap, he rode blindly into another.
Far up in the hills, riding savagely, he knew not where,
nor cared, vowing dark vengeance on Haig, his attention
was drawn at last by the weird and ominous bellowing
of cattle. Following the sound, he came to a
little hollow where a hundred or more cattle were gathered,
like the rapt spectators in an amphitheater, around
two bulls engaged in mortal combat. One, as Seth
quickly saw, was a red Hereford, his best thoroughbred;
the other, a black Angus, and even more valuable, was
Haig&rsquo;s. The red bull, bleeding from many wounds, was
plainly being worsted in the encounter. With a roar
of rage, Huntington drew his revolver, urged his unwilling
horse down into the arena where the turf was
torn up for many yards around the combatants, circled
about until he could take sure aim, and emptied every
chamber of the gun into the head and neck of the Angus.
The bull sank to the ground, head first, in a lumbering
mass that kicked once or twice, shivered, and lay still.</p>
<p>But the Hereford, red-eyed with blood and fury,
turned on Huntington, and drove him, barely escaping
being gored, into the thick timber. In a place of safety
Huntington jerked his horse around, and sat limp in
the saddle, staring down at the scene of his final humiliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Even my
own bull turns on me. Haw! Haw!&rdquo; His hollow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
hoarse, and unmirthful laughter echoed among the pines.
&ldquo;Great joke! Haig will like that. And the rest of
them. Hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Haig! And the Angus! Well, there&rsquo;d got to
be a show-down anyhow pretty soon. He dismounted,
and seated himself on a fallen tree trunk, and gave
himself up to reflections upon which it is only the most
obvious kindness and discretion to draw the curtain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW</h3>
</div>
<p>The days dragged by under the burdens of doubt
and torture, and out of the Valley of the Shadow
came Philip Haig, with some new and disquieting
thoughts to occupy him in his convalescence. Toiling
up out of the darkness, where foul fiends seemed to
have torn and mangled his body with their fiery claws,
his fingers were still warm from the pressure of a soft,
guiding hand; there was a haunting memory of kisses
on his forehead, of a cheek laid close to his; and he
could still hear the gentle but commanding voice that
told him to be patient&ndash;&ndash;to be still&ndash;&ndash;that life was
coming back to him.</p>
<p>Life! As if he cared for life! Had he not spent
years on years in seeking what just now had been in his
very grasp, only to be withdrawn by two caressing
hands? And Doctor Morris, on the day of his final
visit, had left him no possibility of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gaylord has saved your life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
could do little. It was her nursing that pulled you
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wanted much to tell the doctor just how much
value he placed on that life. But to what purpose?
Doctors lived in their own peculiar atmosphere of conceit
and self-deception, crowing like a hen over a new-laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
egg whenever they chanced to bring back a soul to
the miseries from which it had struggled to escape. It
would be a waste of words, for Norris would never understand.
Would Marion? Cold terror seized him at
the thought of the coming, the inevitable scene with her.
She, he realized vaguely, was different from&ndash;&ndash;from all
the others he had ever seen and looked down upon
from his safe heights of cynical hatred and contempt.
She was not selfish or mercenary&ndash;&ndash;not consciously
selfish or mercenary. And she was not vile. But she
was all the more dangerous because her heart was pure.
She was too high-bred, too fine, to demand payment of
his debt; but her very reticence and delicacy, he foresaw,
would make his repudiation of that debt&ndash;&ndash;that
factitious debt&ndash;&ndash;more difficult. Twice or thrice, as
he struggled with his problem, he was conscious of a
curious, disturbing thrill. She loved him. There had
been a time, long, long ago&ndash;&ndash;But now he was a man;
he had learned his lesson; and he knew that the chains
would be no less hateful because they were made of
gold.</p>
<p>There came a day when he sat, wrapped in blankets,
in an armchair near the window, where he could see the
grass waving in the sunlight on the slope above the
cottage, and the pines bending in the breeze high up the
hill. Marion, near him, her hands folded in her lap,
looked sometimes out of the window but more often at
him, though his eyes avoided hers. She was scarcely
less pale than he, and very tired and worn. Despite
Hillyer&rsquo;s protestations she had slept little in the ten
days of Philip&rsquo;s peril; for she would trust no one but
herself to do with iron determination exactly what the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
doctor had commanded. Philip&rsquo;s pitiable pleading for
water in his semi-delirium her love alone was strong
enough to resist. But this was the last day of her watch
over him. In an hour she must go. She had frankly
asked Robert to let her have this last afternoon alone
with Philip; and had promised him that he should then
have the answer to every question that he had loyally
put aside for her.</p>
<p>They sat a long time silent, while the shadow of the
cottage lengthened on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t worth it, Miss Gaylord,&rdquo; Haig said at
length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Norris tells me that you saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad if he thinks I helped a little,&rdquo; she answered,
trying to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left me no room for doubt. Very plain-spoken
is Doctor Norris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he exaggerated,&rdquo; she protested gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jim&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s all right in his way, but he couldn&rsquo;t have
done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am paid,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Knowing that you live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You think you mean that, perhaps, but you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean what?&rdquo; she asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you are paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away, and looked out the window, her
heart throbbing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell you something, Miss Gaylord,&rdquo; he went
on resolutely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not grateful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m not glad to owe my life to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t asked&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not directly.&rdquo; He hesitated a moment.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this: If a man had saved my life, I could pay
him. There would be a clasp of the hand, and a look
from man to man. Or I should save his life in turn, or
do him some service. Or&ndash;&ndash;there are other ways.
There&rsquo;s Pete&rsquo;s way and Jim&rsquo;s way&ndash;&ndash;of paying. But I
can&rsquo;t pay you in any of the ways I could pay a man.
And I can&rsquo;t pay in the only way a woman knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right, he thought. He was doing it brutally.
He must try another method. There followed a long
silence, while he tried to frame a speech that would tell
her, and would not hurt too much; for now, strangely,
he found himself reluctant to give her pain, even to put
himself in a false light before her&ndash;&ndash;to be misunderstood.
At last he leaned toward her&ndash;&ndash;forced her to
meet his gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you&ndash;&ndash;if you had ever loved one man with
all your heart and soul&ndash;&ndash;held him as dear to you
as life&ndash;&ndash;dearer than life itself&ndash;&ndash;without whom
life would be impossible&ndash;&ndash;could you ever love
another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all her anguish she was able to detect the trap
that he had set for her. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; would cheapen the
quality and deny the finality of her love for him; &ldquo;no&rdquo;
would be an acceptance of the doom and tragedy she saw
shadowing his eyes. She did not answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, you dare not answer that,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;I suppose I ought to tell you the story. But I won&rsquo;t.
It&rsquo;s long, and not a pretty story at all. But this much
I will tell you. I gave one woman all I had to give.
She threw it away&ndash;&ndash;and laughed at me. I have nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took it very bravely and very quietly, as it seemed
to him. He felt a certain admiration. There was
good blood in the girl. Her father must have been
worth knowing. His thoughts would have taken a different
direction&ndash;&ndash;would have been nothing so complacent
if he had known just what she was thinking.
His speech, terrifying at first, had actually renewed a
hope that had fallen very low. She did not believe a
word of what he had said, that is, of his having nothing
more to give. Whenever did woman believe any such
thing as that, no matter how solemnly, on what stoutest
oaths, with what tragic air a man has told it to her?
Love is not love that doubts its own compelling power.
And Marion, gazing fondly at Philip now, felt somewhat
as a mother feels who smilingly indulges some
childhood tragedy of her boy, knowing that it will pass
as the cloud upon an April sky. If this was the worst
he had to say to her&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But it was not the worst. Philip felt an intense relief
to see her accept the situation with such unexpected
calm. He admired her consciously now,&ndash;&ndash;for her intelligence.
He began to think that he might almost take
her hand, and thank her, as he would thank a man for
doing him a service, however mistakenly. But something
held him back from that folly. He wondered a
little at her silence, and it was by way of breaking it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
before it should become embarrassing that he searched
for something safe and commonplace to say to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my own fault, you know, that I was injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why your own fault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in a bad humor. I lost my self-control. And
I got what I deserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought she would ask him why he had been in a
bad humor, and he purposed to say that he was raging
in discontent, longing for the white road again. It
would be safe enough now, no doubt, to tell her in this
fashion that if ever she should come to the Park again
she would not find him there. But his words had suggested
something entirely different to her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with him?&rdquo; she asked, in
sudden vague anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;Sunnysides? I wish you&rsquo;d please sell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell him? Sell Sunnysides?&rdquo; His voice betrayed
his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t ridden him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her voice failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m going to ride him? Just as soon as I get
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some seconds she sat dazed. It was so utterly unexpected.
The thought had not once occurred to her
that he would try again what had all but cost him his
life. It is at some such point as this that man&rsquo;s and
woman&rsquo;s natures make one of their many departures
from the parallel. To Haig the taming of Sunnysides
now meant everything; to Marion it seemed a useless, a
worse than useless risk, a wicked waste. What had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the worth, then, of all her labor of love, if it was to be
thrown away? He would be killed the next time.
And in the horror with which she foresaw that tragic
end of all that she had planned and builded, her courage
and confidence fell away from her, and left her weak
and helpless. She uttered a thin, little cry, and slipped
to the floor on her knees, clasping his emaciated hand
that lay on an arm of the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she cried frantically. &ldquo;Please,
Philip! Please promise me you won&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she broke down completely, her head drooped,
and she sank down in a heap, with her face between her
hands.</p>
<p>Haig was stunned. He had blundered again. Fool,
not to have let her go away from him in silence, in calm!
He looked down at that crumpled figure, at the mass
of tawny hair, with the red-gold lights in it, the enticing
soft whiteness of her neck where the hair curved cleanly
upward, the graceful slope of the shoulders that now
shook with sobs. And something stirred in him, something
deep, too deep to be reached and overpowered.
It grew until it sang through all his being, a feeling
such as he had never known before. She was fine and
beautiful; she was a thing to be desired; and he had
only to reach out, and take her for his own. Before he
was aware of it, he had stretched out his hand until it
almost touched her hair. Then from across the years
a mocking voice rang out shrill and cold and cruel:
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you go mussing up my apartment, Pipo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew back his hand with a jerk, and clutched the
chair; and sat bolt upright, while every nerve rang
with the alarm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>Minutes passed. The sobs gradually subsided; the
figure on the floor slowly ceased its convulsive movements;
and again a deep silence enveloped the room.
Out on the brown-green slope the sun&rsquo;s rays were
slanting low, the shadow of the cottage climbed the
hill.</p>
<p>Well, Haig thought, he had bungled the business
after all. That was what came of trying to do it nicely,
with delicacy. Hard words were the kindest in the
end, because the quickest understood.</p>
<p>She had not yet lifted her head when he turned to
look at her again; and that made it easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave the ranch&ndash;&ndash;just now,&rdquo; he said slowly.
&ldquo;If I could, I would. So I think&ndash;&ndash;I think you ought
to go back home&ndash;&ndash;to New York, I mean&ndash;&ndash;at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer. And it was only after another
silence that she looked up at him, and he saw that her
eyes were still filled with tears, and there was a curious
little puckering of her chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you wished you could repay me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, wondering. &ldquo;But I told
you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is a way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me you will not ride Sunnysides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t promise that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things you couldn&rsquo;t possibly understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a little thing!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If I gave you that, I should indeed have nothing
left. You would have all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that she could not in the least understand.
But she knew she could not move him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then promise me,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll not
try it until you are quite, quite well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. I promise you that!&rdquo; he replied, with a grim
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&ndash;&ndash;Philip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently she arose, and looked down at him with a
long, lingering gaze that seemed to be searching for
something in his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take just what Jim gives you?&rdquo; she asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not try to&ndash;&ndash;boss him about the medicines and
the food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise to obey orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be very careful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved slowly toward the door. But halfway
there she stopped, and turned to look at him again.
How could she leave him now? She couldn&rsquo;t! She
couldn&rsquo;t! He was gazing away from her, out through
the window. Wasn&rsquo;t he going to say a word to her&ndash;&ndash;of
farewell? She came back unsteadily, and stood behind
his chair, her hands stretched out above his head.
Then suddenly, impulsively, not touching him with
her hands, she leaned down, and kissed his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; she said, her voice breaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he answered gently, but without turning
his head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>He heard the door opened and closed, very softly.
After that he sat a long time in silence. Well, she was
gone! It had been a trying afternoon, and he was glad
to have it ended. And yet the room seemed to be
extraordinarily empty, as it had never been before his
illness. The stillness rather oppressed him. Damn it
all, sickness did strange things to a man! Took a lot
out of him! He straightened himself in his chair.</p>
<p>Presently Jim entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim!&rdquo; said Haig. &ldquo;Here we are again, eh?
I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You eat, she come back,&rdquo; Jim answered shrewdly.</p>
<p>Haig looked at him sharply, but the Chinaman&rsquo;s face
was like a paper mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; he cried savagely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Hillyer was waiting for her at the barn when
she came at last, with a smile that eased his
anxiety, if only in an inconsiderable degree. But he
saw, as he took her handbag and bundle, and placed
them in the automobile, that she had been crying. This
gladdened while it angered him, and he was lost among
the many interpretations that might be put upon those
signs of distress. Had she come to the end of her infatuation?
Had she been subjected to insults as the reward
of her service? He dared not ask her such questions&ndash;&ndash;not
yet; but he was resolved (and there were
material reasons, too, for that decision) to have his own
case settled, one way or another, at once.</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke more than a conventional
word or two until Hillyer, after full speed down Haig&rsquo;s
road to the junction, slowed up on the main highway
along the Brightwater. It was the serenest of summer
evenings, very still and fragrant, with a touch of
autumn in the air. The eastern sky was filled with
pale golds and pinks, and the foothills were warm with
purples. Marion&rsquo;s face was averted from Hillyer, and
her eyes were fixed, not on the soft alternations of color
in the sky, but on Thunder Mountain, where the only
clouds to be seen in all the expanse of blue lay low upon
its uncompromising head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; said Hillyer, at length.</p>
<p>She did not miss the note in his voice that exposed his
intention, but long preparation for this moment enabled
her to face him calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, Robert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have much
to say to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to-morrow,&rdquo; he began abruptly. &ldquo;Will
you go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow? Go with you?&rdquo; she repeated, with a
little start of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Will you go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand, Robert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be in Denver the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t know your time was so short. I&rsquo;m
afraid&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve spoiled your visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, Marion, if you&rsquo;ll go back with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ready. I haven&rsquo;t half finished my visit
with Claire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was, after all, somewhat confused, for she had
not expected him to approach the subject in just this
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the summer is almost gone. It&rsquo;s near the end
of August,&rdquo; persisted Hillyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another month of good weather. And September,
Claire says, is the most beautiful of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, unless Huntington&rsquo;s right. He told
me only yesterday that it&rsquo;s going to be an early winter.
There&rsquo;s come a chill in the air even since I&rsquo;ve been
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she replied, recovering her composure.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out with the last stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get caught in an avalanche or something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Seth does want to get rid of me!&rdquo; she
said, with a faint laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose you stay too late, and get caught.
You&rsquo;d have to remain here all winter. The Park,
Huntington says, is as tight as a jail after the snows
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claire stays here through the winter sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt a fresh alarm, and showed it. It would be
just like her! he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Marion!&rdquo; he said, plunging at last.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve obeyed your order not to say anything about&ndash;&ndash;the
future. I meant not to say anything until the
time was up. But you must see I can&rsquo;t keep silent now,
after&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s happened. You must know I can&rsquo;t go
away and leave you without knowing what&ndash;&ndash;it all
means. You said you&rsquo;d tell me as soon as you&rsquo;d finished
nursing&ndash;&ndash;him. No, wait, please! Let me say it at
once. You know I love you. I want you to marry me.
I need you, Marion. There&rsquo;s never been an hour, a
minute that I haven&rsquo;t thought of you. I can&rsquo;t work&ndash;&ndash;I
can&rsquo;t do anything without you. I love you more
than&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Robert!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it
harder for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harder&ndash;&ndash;for&ndash;&ndash;both of us?&rdquo; he repeated slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Hillyer, while he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
spoke, had half-consciously stopped the automobile,
which stood now, humming softly, in the middle of the
road that stretched white and empty ahead of them and
behind them. The night breeze had risen, blowing cold
from the snows, and the shadows were creeping down
into the valley, as if they came from dark caverns in the
hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. I must
tell you. I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me say it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Well, Robert,
I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you to love me!&rdquo; he rejoined, almost
savagely. &ldquo;I only ask you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she interrupted, placing a hand on his
arm. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped him with a pressure on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, not knowing, I almost consented,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;But something checked me&ndash;&ndash;held me back.
You remember how restless I was&ndash;&ndash;how troubled.
You would have laughed at me if I had told you. But
something seemed to be calling me&ndash;&ndash;a voice from a
long distance. I laughed at myself for a foolish girl&ndash;&ndash;at
first. I said it was nerves, and I fought against it.
And it was then that I came nearest to saying yes to
you, thinking that I was indeed foolish in holding back.
I liked you. I&rsquo;ve always liked you, Robert. You&rsquo;d
been such a splendid friend, and I was grateful. I
wanted to repay you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly, and a flush mounted swiftly
into her pale cheeks. Repay! The word recalled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
sharply to her, acutely and painfully, all that Haig had
said about paying her. Were they, then, in the same
dreadful situation, she and Haig, with debts they could
never pay? For the first time some sense of the terrible
finality of his decision struck in upon her secret hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of that!&rdquo; Robert was saying, seizing the
moment of silence. &ldquo;I never&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But always, when I was about to yield&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&rsquo;t.
I didn&rsquo;t know why then. But now I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;Haig?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He could not bring himself to speak
the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Robert. I love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took all the courage she possessed. But she owed
it to him and to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe
it! You are not yourself, Marion. You are worn
out. You have been fascinated. He&rsquo;s strange&ndash;&ndash;different&ndash;&ndash;new
to you. It&rsquo;s your imagination, not your
heart, that&rsquo;s been&ndash;&ndash;won. He&rsquo;s led you on by&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite wrong. It&rsquo;s
not his fault at all. He doesn&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I know that kind of fellow. You
didn&rsquo;t need to leave New York to find plenty like him.
He only wants to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert!&rdquo; she cried warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hates me, I think,&rdquo; she replied sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why in the world do you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He was floundering.
&ldquo;What do you know about him, anyhow?
Who is he? Where did he come from?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>That sounded so much like Seth Huntington that she
smiled, thinking of the picture that he must have drawn
for Hillyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very little about him,&rdquo; she replied quietly.
&ldquo;But I know that Cousin Seth is mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know he hates you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made that clear in the beginning&ndash;&ndash;not me
alone, but all women. He shunned me. He told me
twice that I must not speak to him again. And this
afternoon, while you waited for me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her voice
broke, with a laugh that was half a sob. &ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;finished
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was rude to you!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make
him&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her hand quickly on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He was very gentle&ndash;&ndash;and kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Hillyer demanded, almost imperatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that&ndash;&ndash;he couldn&rsquo;t leave the ranch just now,
so I&rsquo;d better go back to New York&ndash;&ndash;at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, did he?&rdquo; cried Hillyer angrily, his chivalry
for the moment dominant. But then he saw suddenly
another meaning, for him, in the brutal ultimatum; and
his face brightened. &ldquo;That settles it, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
exclaimed eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settles what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ll go with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;m not ready yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence while Hillyer, buoyed up with
new hope, made some hurried calculations.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen, Marion!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Denver,
and come back in a week or ten days. I&rsquo;ll arrange
things so that I can stay here until&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robert! You won&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at her blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it so hard for me!&rdquo; she cried pathetically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you already that I cannot marry
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why! Why!&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t myself&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve nothing to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you love him after he has&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told me he does not love me?&rdquo; she said, taking the
words from him. &ldquo;Then how can you love me when I
have said the same thing to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struggled desperately, in deep water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different, Marion. You don&rsquo;t hate me&ndash;&ndash;I
think. You say you like me. That&rsquo;s enough now&ndash;&ndash;to
start with. It&rsquo;s all I ask. I&rsquo;ll try to make you
happy, and I&rsquo;ll wait for love. You shall have all the
things in the world you want. I&rsquo;m making scads of
money. Everything I touch just rolls up into bank
notes. I want you to come and spend all that money
for me. Remember, Marion, your father wished it.
If he were here now&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she put in with sudden fire. &ldquo;If he were
here now do you know what he would say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt that he had blundered, and made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would say to me&ndash;&ndash;Oh, I can hear him now!
He would say: &lsquo;Follow your heart, daughter. Love&rsquo;s
the only thing in the world that really counts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled triumphantly, but wistfully. And Hillyer
was still silent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy wasn&rsquo;t very good at quoting Scripture,&rdquo; she
went on musingly, &ldquo;but he used to say: &lsquo;Better a
dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and
hatred therewith.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any hatred therewith!&rdquo; cried Hillyer
desperately. &ldquo;I love you, Marion, and if you don&rsquo;t
love me&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t hate me. So there&rsquo;s more than
half of it, and&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t we trust the future a little
bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo; he asked, shifting
his line of attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied, with a helpless gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go back to New York without money
enough to take your proper place in the world. Of
course, if you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert!&rdquo; she interrupted sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean it just the same!&rdquo; he replied stoutly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to take care of you, and if you won&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;See
here, Marion! I simply refuse to be turned down this
way. I&rsquo;ll not take your stubborn, whimsy little &lsquo;no&rsquo;
for my answer. You&rsquo;re on my hands, thank God!
whether you like it or not. Maybe you won&rsquo;t love me.
Maybe you won&rsquo;t marry me. We&rsquo;ll see about that!
But I&rsquo;m going to look after you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to take care
of you, just the same&ndash;&ndash;and you can just stop tightening
those lips&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re not as red as they ought to be&ndash;&ndash;and
you can make up your mind that you can boss me
so far and no farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion smiled at him indulgently, but gratefully, and
even a little proudly; for she had been very proud of
him in the days when only friendship was spoken of.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
She did not in the least resent his speech; but neither
did she answer him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late, Robert,&rdquo; she said, shivering a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve no warm wrap
for the night air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the lap-robe around her, and started the
automobile. Through the gathering night they drove,
almost without speaking, to Huntington&rsquo;s, where the
best supper that Claire could contrive from the limited
stores at her disposal awaited the prodigal. There was
naturally some constraint at table. Huntington had
made his peace with Hillyer, having apologized humbly,
and expatiated on the cause of his wrath. But he did
not know how he stood with Marion, who had been a
long time in the camp of the enemy, and who doubtless
knew too of his speech about her trunks. He had not
dared to ask Hillyer whether he had related that incident
to her, and he felt the need of extreme discretion
until he should discover what kind of a rod she had in
pickle for him, or, at any rate, until the time should be
propitious to tell her that he was sorry for his conduct.
Marion was tired, and disinclined to talk, while Hillyer,
on his side, had his mind fully occupied, between his
deal in mines and his deal in love, in both of which he
had encountered unexpected difficulties. Only Claire
was gay and untroubled, and she accepted eagerly the
task of saving the party from awkward silences. For
once in many moons she was allowed to talk unchecked,
and she made the most of her opportunity.</p>
<p>After supper, Marion announced her purpose to go
to bed at once. She was sure, she declared, that she
could sleep &ldquo;around the clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off before you&rsquo;re up, then,&rdquo; said Hillyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go to-morrow?&rdquo; asked Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. It means thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll sit on the veranda a few minutes,&rdquo; said
Marion. &ldquo;Not long, though. I&rsquo;m dreadfully sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long. They found they had little to say
to each other, since the one subject of which both were
thinking, each from a different point of view, was tacitly
barred. And Hillyer soon saw that Marion was sorely
in need of rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to bed now, dear girl!&rdquo; he said presently.
&ldquo;And please take good care of yourself. I want to see
the color back in your cheeks when I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Robert,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be quite all
right in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t really think of staying here all
winter?&rdquo; he ventured to ask diffidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then good-by&ndash;&ndash;until you hear my horn in the
road down yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Robert, and good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him both her hands, for a moment, with a
tenderness that lingered with him far on his way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>INTERLUDE</h3>
</div>
<p>August ripened into September, and the Park
underwent a subtle and fascinating change. In
the meadows the hay lay in long windrows, golden green;
on the slopes vermilion flowers succeeded blue; in the
sunsets tender pinks yielded to burnt orange and vivid
red. The nights had grown perceptibly colder, but the
days were still warm and dry and radiant, though with a
tang in the air that stirred the blood. And a thousand
perfumes, known and unknown, distilled from meadow
and field and forest, scented every vagrant breeze.</p>
<p>Marion was soon herself again, in body if not in
mind. A few long nights of sleep, a few days in the
saddle, and sufficient nourishment (for she had neglected
herself at Haig&rsquo;s, despite Jim&rsquo;s solicitude) restored her
physically to what she had been on the day of Haig&rsquo;s
accident. But she, too, had changed, and as subtly as
the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s come over Marion?&rdquo; asked Huntington of
Claire one day, after he had caught himself regarding
her with the rapt interest of a discoverer.</p>
<p>Claire looked at him pityingly. She knew, but she
was not going to tell him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rdquo; he replied doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s prettier than ever&ndash;&ndash;but so are you. That
isn&rsquo;t it. She&rsquo;s kind of&ndash;&ndash;It&rsquo;s no use. I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claire laughed, and then became severe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s forgiven you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he asseverated, not without embarrassment.
&ldquo;You can see for yourself that she&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; she retorted maliciously. &ldquo;Perhaps
if you&rsquo;d done such a noble thing as nursing Haig back
to life you&rsquo;d be different too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d see him in&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do anything
of the kind. Your bark&rsquo;s worse than your bite, sir.
And besides, while I think of it, you really must stop
saying &lsquo;hell&rsquo; and &lsquo;damn&rsquo; so much. The habit&rsquo;s growing
on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having no ready answer to that speech, he merely
looked at her, perhaps a little guiltily, then bent down
and kissed her, and hurried out of the house. He was,
in truth, though he never would have had the courage to
acknowledge it, even to Claire, ashamed of himself, and
anxious too. His inflammable temper had rather out-flamed
itself in its last-recorded performance, and he
had begun to suspect that it had been responsible for
some, though by no means all, of his troubles. The
killing of Haig&rsquo;s bull, he now realized, was a foolish and
indefensible act, which could be traced easily to him
because of the bull that was gored; and he must prepare
to account to Haig for it. And so, knowing that
he would again be in the wrong, as in the affair at the
post-office, he was torn between accentuated bitterness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
toward Haig and growing discontent with himself. He
would never be afraid of Haig, but he was becoming
steadily more afraid of Marion. Whether it was that
he had really developed intuition, which told him of
Marion&rsquo;s spiritual growth, or that he was in constant
dread lest she make some new demand upon him in
regard to Haig, he lived in much awe of her. She had
once spoken, on a memorable occasion, of making peace
between Haig and himself. It would be just like her,
wouldn&rsquo;t it, to try to bring them together? Well, let
her try it! He would be the last man in Paradise Park.
And so on, until he was once more almost satisfied with
himself.</p>
<p>The faithful Smythe, meanwhile, brought Marion
almost daily news of Philip. That he was rapidly recovering
she heard with a ringing joy, which had its
alloy of fear; for she knew that the day he felt himself
to be in full possession of his powers he would attempt
again to conquer Sunnysides. So from day to day her
apprehension mounted until it became well-nigh insupportable.
And her own helplessness maddened her.
What could she do? Nothing! Nothing but wait,
and pray God to protect him. Every night she prayed
for him, and every morning, on her knees; and every
hour the prayer was in her heart. She rode sometimes
as far as the farther edge of the woods that crowned the
ridge, and looked long at the little valley, and at the
smoke rising in a thin spiral from the ranch house that
she could not see. At the right of it would be the cottage,
and at the left the barn, and the corral where
Sunnysides bided his time. And then, having looked
until she could endure no more, she would ride slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
home, to await the next coming of Smythe with news.</p>
<p>Once she went to the glade of the columbines. She
did not feel any longer the antipathy she once felt to
the spot that had, in one devastating moment, revealed
to her the fatuity of her dreams. Now she was in
search of the old hopes that she had once revelled in,
while she gathered armloads of columbines, and imagined
they were for Philip.</p>
<p>Dismounting eagerly at the foot of the little hill, she
plunged through the brush, and halted at the margin of
the glade, stricken with the keenest disappointment.
The columbines were gone; only a brave, pale blossom
here and there lingered pathetically in a waste of dried
and drooping stems. She stood staring at them a moment;
then, with a cry, she threw herself down among
them, and gave herself up to grief, letting the tears
come in what flood they would, while her hand clutched
one poor survivor of the summer glory.</p>
<p>Gone, then, like the summer, were all those dreams.
And very soon must come the end of all. Barely two
weeks remained to her in the Park,&ndash;&ndash;barely two weeks
in which the miracle that she awaited could be wrought.
What miracle could move him when her love had failed?
And yet&ndash;&ndash;Once, in her desperation, she suggested to
Claire and Seth that she should remain all winter in
the Park; but they rose up together against any such
scheme. It was absurd, they agreed. They would be
delighted to have her with them as many summers as
she might wish; and they were already counting on her
return to them next June. But the Park in winter was
no place for a woman, unless she had been long inured
to such hardships as were involved in that hibernation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Claire had remained two winters there, it was true, but
Seth had vowed that she should never miss the last stage
again. Marion&rsquo;s proposal only clinched the matter the
more firmly; and it was eventually agreed that Claire
should go with Marion to New York, where they would
live very quietly, taking what pleasures their means
would permit, until spring should bring them back to
the mountains. And so, barring a miracle, she was at
the end of her hopes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she had heard from Robert. He was
nearly wild, he wrote. The big deal was going slowly&ndash;&ndash;not
badly, but with maddening delays. He was
tempted to &ldquo;chuck the whole business,&rdquo; though it meant
thousands, perhaps half a million. Yet how could he
do that? He was working for her; and if he left
Denver the deal would certainly fall through. But
there was yet time; any day the stubborn partner might
yield; and so on. Poor Robert! thought Marion. She
imagined what Philip would have done if he had wanted
her as Robert did. Would any deal, any prospect of
millions, have kept him away from her? So she reasoned,
forgetting entirely the other side of the case.
Haig, if she could have asked him, would have told her:
yes, that&rsquo;s all very well, but the man would have to get
those thousands or other thousands afterwards, just the
same; a woman wants to have her cake and eat it too;
and so much the worse for the man if he cannot dance
attendance on her and make money for her at the same
time!</p>
<p>She wrote to Robert that be must not think of leaving
his business. Moreover, she would soon be in Denver,
on her way back home.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>In the late afternoon Haig leaned against Sunnysides&rsquo;
corral, smoking his pipe and gazing fixedly at the golden
outlaw. The air was very still, almost too still, as if
nature had paused before a sudden and violent alteration
of her mood. In the bright sky, a little hard even
for September, there was no cloud, except on the western
horizon, where dark vapors hovered over the bald head
of Thunder Mountain. The scent of the harvest in the
meadows blended with the odor of burning pine that
came from the ranch house, where Flick built the fire
for supper. On the hill the pines were still, but the
brook babbled on, and there was an incessant low twittering
of birds in the cottonwoods.</p>
<p>Haig had now fully recovered. He had taken to his
horse again some days before, to ride a little the first
day, and more the next, each day adding something to
his exercise, until he felt the blood running warmly in
his veins, and his muscles tightening at his will. Then
he had hardened himself with every kind of labor around
the ranch. For he was impatient to remove the stigma
of doubt that Sunnysides had burned into his soul. He
had told Marion that she was incapable of understanding
why he must conquer Sunnysides. He was not sure
that he understood it himself. But he knew that he
must. Ever since that day when he had fled into the
world he had fought to be master of himself; and his
way of being master of himself was to be master of
every man and every animal and every obstacle that
appeared across his path,&ndash;&ndash;that irresponsible, uncharted
path that had neither beginning nor end, that led he
knew not where nor cared. Every moment was a moment
to itself, and every day was its own if he had done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
what he had set out to do. His one purpose in life was
not to be beaten, never to fail, though he should throw
away to-morrow what he had won to-day. So it was
that to conquer Sunnysides was for the moment the one
thing that counted, and he would have no rest until it
was done.</p>
<p>Twilight settled down upon the valley. Haig&rsquo;s pipe
went out, and still he stood gazing at Sunnysides. In
the dusk the horse glowed like a living jewel that holds
the light when the sun has gone. Night fell, and the
golden hide became a shimmer in the dark, as the outlaw
moved restlessly to and fro in his prison. Then,
of a sudden, with the unexpectedness and unreason of a
dog&rsquo;s wolf-howl at the rising moon, there rose from the
gloom of the corral a shrill, wild neigh that shattered
the peaceful silence of the night.</p>
<p>Haig left the fence, and walked swiftly to the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farrish!&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll break Sunnysides
to-morrow. Tell Pete and Curly not to ride away
in the morning. The cattle can wait.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE CHALLENGE OF THE BRUTE</h3>
</div>
<p>There had been yellow, mellow weather for weeks
on weeks, but this day dawned hard and cold.
Some projected rancor of the winter was in the air.
Westward the peaks were blanketed with thick gray
clouds, while eastward a sullen redness showed where
the sun strove to rise on an angry world. The wind
was the kind that scrapes raw the nerves, buffeting man
and beast with cross-currents and unexpected blasts,
howling and shrieking around chimneys and gables,
covering everything with dust and sand.</p>
<p>Haig awoke to hear the wind tearing at the shutters
and the roof, the pines on the hillside thundering like
surf, the hills reverberating with the maddest trumpetings.
He lay a moment listening; his pulse quickened,
at the sound of all that tumult; and he leaped from his
bed calling loudly for Slim Jim. It was a day for
battle. The very elements were up and at it, as if all
nature had enlisted in the struggle between man and
brute.</p>
<p>For all his eagerness, he ate his breakfast leisurely,
resolved to make no such error as he had made before.
There should be no mad haste and no anger; no working
on an empty stomach, on nerves drawn taut. Bacon
and eggs and buckwheat cakes, with coffee and a single
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
pipe, occupied an hour or more; and then, feeling fit
for anything, he set out for the corrals.</p>
<p>He did not scruple this time to take every precaution
known to the experts of the corrals. Bill was mounted
on the wisest horse in the stables, with a lariat ready
against the event of Sunnysides trying the fence again.
Then Haig directed Farrish, Curly, and Pete to rope
and saddle the outlaw, saving himself for the supreme
struggle. But to their astonishment there was none of
the difficulties in the preliminaries that they encountered
on the previous occasion; only two or three vicious
movements, no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foxy, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Farrish to the outlaw, when
the saddle was on. &ldquo;Savin&rsquo; yourself, are you, you yellow
devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse was led as before into the larger corral.
He stepped nimbly, obediently, as if resistance were the
farthest thing from his thoughts, even when Haig, his
arch-enemy, walked up to him, grasped the bridle, and
looked steadily into his eyes. For a moment all stood
still, as the challenge passed between man and brute.
Then Haig tested the cinches of the saddle, looked carefully
around him, and disposed the men with a final
word to each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then! Off with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farrish removed the last rope, and then only the
bridle rein in Haig&rsquo;s hand, and the fence yonder, stoutly
repaired since the last battle, remained between Sunnysides
and the sandhills of the San Luis. True, only a
fence and a guard had held him all these weeks of his
captivity, but that fence had been built up, on his
arrival, two planks higher than the one in which he now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
found himself again, and from which he had all but
escaped at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>Haig put his feet cautiously into the stirrup, and
sprang into the saddle. He was prepared for a repetition
of the trick that had almost cost him his life, and
ready to swing himself out of the saddle if Sunnysides
should go over backward again. But the horse was indeed
&ldquo;foxy&rdquo;; one would have said that he knew his
man, and would waste no time or energy on man&oelig;uvers
that his enemy had discounted. For some seconds he
stood quite motionless, while Haig settled firmly in his
seat, and gripped the bridle rein expectantly. At length
the horse lifted and turned his head, and looked, as it
appeared, toward the western mountains, half hidden
in the gray swirl of clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, over there&rsquo;s the San Luis,&rdquo; muttered Haig.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a long way, and you&rsquo;re not going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farrish grinned. But Pete stood like a wooden Indian,
so still and intent was he, with his black eyes fixed
on the outlaw. Curly loosened the coils of the lariat in
his hands. In a corner of the corral Bill, mounted and
watchful, held his rope ready for a throw.</p>
<p>Still Sunnysides did not move. But his tail swished
with the slow and menacing movement of a tiger&rsquo;s, and
there was just a quiver of muscles under his golden
hide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; called Pete.</p>
<p>And then it came. The horse bounded into the air,
and came down stiff-legged, with a jolt that Haig felt
in every bone. Then he leaped sideways half a dozen
feet, and Haig was flung far over, hanging perilously in
the saddle. With almost one motion the horse was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
the air again, to come down with the same frightful,
jarring shock. Instantly thereupon he lunged forward,
stopped short, ducked his head, and narrowly missed
hurling Haig like a stone from a catapult.</p>
<p>All these tactics were repeated with variations; and
then, of a sudden, as if he thought Haig had forgotten
his experience by this time, he reared, and with the same
lightning swiftness as before, went over backward on
the ground. But Haig was too quick for him. He
swung himself to one side, released his right foot from
the stirrup, and rolled away from beneath the horse as
they came down with a crash. At the same instant Pete
and Curly rushed in, and the horse leaped to his feet
only to be brought down again with two ropes on his
legs.</p>
<p>Haig, dusty but uninjured, was on his feet in a jiffy,
and leaning over the thwarted outlaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t really think you could do it again, did
you?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a hellyun, though, ain&rsquo;t he!&rdquo; ejaculated
Curly, bracing himself on his rope.</p>
<p>The horse was allowed to rise; Haig climbed cautiously
into the saddle once more; and the same tense
silence as the first ensued, while Sunnysides waited, as
if for inspiration.</p>
<p>Then it was on as before, but with accentuated fury.
The horse, for his opening demonstration, bucked with
his back curved like a steel bow. Haig was almost
propelled into the air, but hung on desperately; and as
the outlaw came down on stiffened legs Haig jabbed the
spurs viciously into his flanks. For Sunnysides had
been too calculating in his measures; it was desirable to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
stir him up, to anger him, to torment him until he
should wear himself out with his furious struggles.</p>
<p>The spurs did it. In an instant Sunnysides was a
demon. All that he had done was like the antics of a
colt compared with what followed. No eye in the corral
could follow and record all his movements. He
was in every part of the enclosure at once, it seemed.
There were instants, too, when he appeared to have disassociated
himself from the earth, and to have taken to
the air as his element. And then the earth rang again
with the clatter of his hoofs; his four legs became a
hundred, and then were four again, pounding like piledrivers,
like steel drills. He flung himself against the
fence until it swayed and creaked, and Haig&rsquo;s legs were
bruised by the violent contact. Clouds of dust rose and
hung above the enclosure, and settled on the outlaw&rsquo;s wet
shoulders, on Haig&rsquo;s sweating face, in his eyes and
nostrils, and in his throat until he was fairly choking.
But though half-blinded, dizzy, and aching in all his
body, Haig hung on, and dug the spurs ceaselessly into
the horse&rsquo;s flanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God! He&rsquo;s got him!&rdquo; cried Farrish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your game&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; yelled Curly tauntingly, dancing
with joy in his corner of the corral.</p>
<p>But the game was not up. Curly&rsquo;s words were barely
out of his mouth when something went wrong with Haig.
Just what happened none could be quite sure of, then or
afterward; but in the midst of Sunnysides&rsquo; plungings,
there came a windmill kind of movement, rather like the
whirling of a dervish, out of which the horse lunged
swiftly forward, and halted violently, with his head
down, and his forelegs stiff before him. It was apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
an elaboration of one of the commonest tricks
of all; and if Haig could have stuck to the saddle then
he probably would have won. But he was thrown. He
went sprawling over the horse&rsquo;s lowered head, and struck
the ground on his head and shoulders, and lay still.</p>
<p>What followed was more marvelous even than the unseating
of Haig with the shout of victory already rising
to his lips. There came a snort that ended in a scream;
and then a flash of yellow through the dust. Bill
Craven, on his horse at one side of the corral, saw it
coming straight toward him, and tried to whirl his
noose. Too late. The outlaw was upon him; his own
pony, rearing, was caught unbalanced; and Bill himself
instinctively leaned backward in the saddle. There was
a terrific impact; the pony was struck squarely on the
left fore-quarter; and horse and rider went down together
in a heap against the fence. Then over them
went the outlaw, trampling them as he leaped and clambered,
taking the top plank with him as he landed outside
the corral on his head and knees. In an instant he
was up; in another, or the same instant, he was off,
with his head down, and belly to earth, with the speed
of a race-horse and the frenzy of a wild thing set free.</p>
<p>Haig was only slightly stunned by the fall. He
heard, though he did not see, the escape of Sunnysides;
and for one black moment all in the present was blotted
out. But that was only the dizziness, and the reeling
pain in his head; and there was the sky filled with gray-black,
contending clouds; and Pete was leaning over
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; asked the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>He reached up one hand, and Pete helped him to his
feet. Swaying a little, he looked around the corral.
Farrish was on the outside, gazing down the road where
Sunnysides was now almost out of sight, a mere yellow
spot in a cloud of dust. Curly was jerking Craven&rsquo;s
horse to its feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter there?&rdquo; called Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; answered Curly.</p>
<p>With Pete at his side, not yet assured that all was well
with him, Haig walked unsteadily to where Bill lay
against the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Craven?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leg broke. My horse fell on me,&rdquo; Bill answered
weakly. He had, besides, a gash in the left side of his
head, from which the blood flowed down his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the barn with him!&rdquo; Haig ordered quietly.</p>
<p>They placed him on a cot, and Pete gave him a long
pull at his ever-ready flask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Bill!&rdquo; said Haig, looking down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my own fault,&rdquo; replied Craven. &ldquo;An&rsquo; it
serves me damned right for lettin&rsquo; him get by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig smiled grimly, then turned to the other men
with orders. He was ominously quiet; even the dullest
of them, the slow-witted Curly, saw and wondered at the
unusual calm that showed on his face and in his accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, business!&rdquo; he said, with swift decision.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take the sorrels, Curly, and drive to Tellurium
for the doctor. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to drive them; I&rsquo;ll not
be on your back for that. Pete, go to the cottage, and
bring my gun. Jim knows where it is. Farrish&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;s
Farrish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>He came leading two ponies from their stalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Farrish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I supposed we&rsquo;d better find out where he&rsquo;s gone, and
see if&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt where he&rsquo;s headed for, is there?&rdquo;
Haig interrupted. &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s going to stop him?
No, saddle Trixy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going alone?&rdquo; said Farrish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s knocked out. Curly&rsquo;s off as soon as he can
start for Tellurium. That leaves you and Pete to look
after the ranch. I may be gone some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t rope him alone!&rdquo; protested Farrish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to. There isn&rsquo;t a horse in the Park
that could overtake him. He&rsquo;ll make for the San Luis,
of course. I&rsquo;ll get help there. Now then, Farrish,
you&rsquo;re in charge of the ranch. If anything should happen
to me, Jim knows where all my papers are. That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farrish hastened to saddle Trixy, coiling a rope at the
saddle horn, and strapping a slicker behind the saddle.
At this moment came Pete from the cottage, bringing the
revolver and cartridge belt, which Haig buckled on while
Farrish led Trixy out in front of the stable.</p>
<p>There was a word or two more to Farrish, about the
cattle and the hay, and Haig swung himself into the
saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Pete, running out of the stable.</p>
<p>He handed a flask of whisky to Haig, who took it,
smiling, and thrust it into a pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure cure for everything, eh, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>But he reached down, and clasped Pete&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be cold, maybe,&rdquo; said the Indian simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, men!&rdquo; said Haig. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take good
care of Craven, of course. And you&rsquo;ll use your best
judgment about everything, Farrish. I&rsquo;m not coming
back without Sunnysides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put spurs to the little bay mare, and dashed away.
Pete and Farrish stood watching him until he had
turned the point of the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; said Farrish.</p>
<p>In the cottage door stood a figure in blue silks, intently
gazing after the disappearing horseman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He catchum, allee light!&rdquo; murmured Slim Jim.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>SMYTHE&rsquo;S LAST BUDGET</h3>
</div>
<p>Seth had heard at the post-office that the deer were
coming down unusually early from their summer
haunts high in the mountains. A fine herd had been
seen just above Bratner&rsquo;s, and Seth proposed to Marion
that she should have a try at them. They would start
early in the morning, stop the night at Bratner&rsquo;s, and be
back home late the second evening. Marion reluctantly
consented, and before going to bed that night she laid out
woolen underwear, her stoutest riding costume, with
divided skirts and knickerbockers and tan boots lacing
almost to her knees. She did not want to go, but, as
more than once before, she yielded to Seth&rsquo;s insistence
rather than attempt an explanation.</p>
<p>That night, however, summer departed from the Park.
A dry storm descended on the valley, and Marion lay
awake while the wind howled around the corners of the
ranch house, of which every timber seemed to be crying
out in agony. She knew that high among the rocks the
storm was smashing about in fury, and even in its sheltered
hollow the house was hammered as if the elements
were bent upon its annihilation. When each prodigious
outcry had spent itself and died away there was still the
moaning and fretting and troubled whimpering that
reminded her of the plaints of an invalid pleading for
help between paroxysms of pain. She was strangely depressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
by it, unaccountably distressed, and was glad
when the first faint whitening of the window curtains
told her of the dawn. She arose and dressed&ndash;&ndash;after
a moment&rsquo;s hesitation&ndash;&ndash;in the costume she had prepared
the night before. Seth surely would not insist on
the shooting trip in such weather, she thought, but it
would please him to see her dressed for it. Besides, the
temperature of her room reminded her that she would
need warm clothes if she went out anywhere on such a
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, Marion!&rdquo; cried Seth sure enough, when he
saw her at the breakfast table. &ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re not discouraged
by a little wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t mean to go on a day like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind, and&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll get soaking wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only a wind storm, and this is the tail end
of it. The sun&rsquo;ll be out in a couple of hours. We
needn&rsquo;t start in a hurry. We&rsquo;ll leave the horses as they
are&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re all ready, bundles and the rest&ndash;&ndash;until we
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seth&rsquo;s optimism annoyed her, but she felt encouraged
when, after breakfast, she stepped out on the veranda
and met the cold and quarrelsome day. A rough blast
struck her in the face; she saw a ragged drift of clouds
torn by the wind; and the whole landscape seemed to
have undergone a melancholy change. Dispirited beyond
measure, despite the one satisfaction that the
weather gave, she re-entered the house, and sank uneasily
into an armchair by the fire.</p>
<p>But Seth&rsquo;s prediction was justified. Toward ten
o&rsquo;clock the wind ceased, and patches of blue began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
show in the blanket of gray. Claire shared Marion&rsquo;s
disinclination to go shooting on such a day (or any other
kind of a day, for her part!), and they stood at the window
actually deploring the blue rents in the clouds, when
Marion uttered a sharp exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smythe!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a day like this!&rdquo; cried Claire.</p>
<p>He had dismounted quickly, and was walking toward
the house; and as he neared the steps Marion saw in his
face what caused her to press her hand on her bosom
to still her heart. Something had happened! And she
had known it all the time&ndash;&ndash;had known it even in her
sleep!</p>
<p>Claire ran to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Smythe!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in
time to cheer us up. We&rsquo;re deep in the mulligrubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered smiling, removing his sombrero with his
customary flourish. But as he advanced he shot a swift,
keen look at Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened!&rdquo; she repeated to herself.</p>
<p>But she came forward with a smile, and shook hands
with Smythe, searching his face. And he was warning
her again. She could have shrieked with impatience
and anxiety, but she held herself, and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A terrible night, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Claire, giving
Smythe a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrific!&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;You know the big pine
that hung over the road just this side of Toumine&rsquo;s?
Well, it&rsquo;s down, right across the road. I had to ride
around it, up among the underbrush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep at all, and I&rsquo;m used to winds, too,&rdquo;
said Claire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It got me up at daylight,&rdquo; Smythe went on. &ldquo;It
didn&rsquo;t look like much of a day for riding, but I got
nervous sitting around listening to my good landlady&ndash;&ndash;one
of the young Martins is threatened with something
or other&ndash;&ndash;and started out to see how the
landscape had been changed. There are trees down
everywhere, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;What are you doing
this morning, Miss Gaylord?&rdquo; he asked, very casually.</p>
<p>She had been silent, watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going shooting, but we&rsquo;ve been waiting to
see if the weather would change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t been out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only on the veranda for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a brisk walk, then. It&rsquo;ll do you good&ndash;&ndash;warm
you up a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said weakly.</p>
<p>She went to her room for her hat, and pinning it on
before the mirror, started at sight of her face, which
had grown very white. She was almost incapable of
thought. The hatpin slipped from her cold fingers, and
fell to the floor. She stared at it strangely before stooping
to pick it up. How could she bear to hear what
Smythe had come to tell her! But it was good of him
to wait until he could tell her alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go too, Mrs. Huntington?&rdquo; Smythe said,
as Marion emerged from her room.</p>
<p>Claire looked at Marion, and wondered at the whiteness
of her face, and the haunted look in her eyes.
Nothing had been said, but she saw there was something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo; she said promptly. &ldquo;The house
suits me this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>Smythe and Marion walked up the hill toward the
tree where Marion had practised shooting. Until they
reached it neither spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Marion, turning suddenly on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunnysides has got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrown, but not hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him a moment, dazed. Then she threw
back her head, and clasped her hands on her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But how you frightened
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smythe looked at her silently; and presently, when
she lowered her eyes, she saw that his face was very
grave. But Haig was unhurt, and Sunnysides had
escaped. She had prayed for just that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she cried, leaning forward to clutch
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s following.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the San Luis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way they brought him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Sunnysides has taken the trail over Thunder
Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand fell from his arm. She swayed, as if she
would collapse. Smythe grabbed her, with an arm
around her waist, and led her, unresisting and dumb, to
a near rock, where he seated her gently, and stood watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
her. He had been too abrupt, he thought; but how
else could he have told her?</p>
<p>She struggled bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; she said at length.</p>
<p>He knew little about the event at the ranch. There
had been a terrific struggle; Haig had almost conquered;
then the outlaw had flung him over his head, trampled
one of his men, breaking his leg, and leaped the fence to
liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Thunder Mountain?&rdquo; cried Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the strangest part of it,&rdquo; Smythe replied.
&ldquo;Even Haig refused at first to believe it. Nobody
knows whether it was deliberate or accidental. It seems
that &lsquo;Red&rsquo; Davis, who works for Toumine, was taking
a load of hay to Lake Cobalt. He&rsquo;d stopped just beyond
the junction of the main road and Haig&rsquo;s to fix the
harness or something, when he heard a furious galloping
in Haig&rsquo;s road. He looked&ndash;&ndash;and Sunnysides must
have been something worth seeing, as he came storming
down on the boy, with red eyes and foaming lips, the
bridle reins dangling at his knees, and the stirrups flying.
&lsquo;Red&rsquo; had never seen him, but he&rsquo;d heard a lot,
and he jumped behind the wagon as if the devil was after
him. But the clatter of hoofs ceased suddenly, and the
boy peered around the hay to see what had happened.
There was Sunnysides, just at the junction, with his
head high, snorting and sniffing, first in the direction of
the wagon, and then the other way up the road. With a
characteristic boyish burst of daring or deviltry, &lsquo;Red&rsquo;
leaped out from his shelter, and yelled. The horse
leaped into the air, let out a wild neigh, and bolted up
the road toward the post-office.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Red&rsquo; watched him until he had disappeared, and
then drove on. It must have been half an hour later
that he heard more mad galloping behind him. He
turned to look, and there came Haig, riding like all
fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you seen a horse?&rsquo; he yelled as he reined up
alongside the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well I just guess!&rsquo; said the boy. &lsquo;Sunnysides.
How did he&ndash;&ndash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How was the saddle&ndash;&ndash;loose or not?&rsquo; asked Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, it hadn&rsquo;t turned&ndash;&ndash;if that&rsquo;s what&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo; replied Haig, starting on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait!&rsquo; the boy shouted. &lsquo;He ain&rsquo;t gone that
way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I say, he ain&rsquo;t gone that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haig stared at him suspiciously. Was the boy trying
to trick him, in emulation of his elders? He was
about to ride on, disdaining to heed him, when something
in the boy&rsquo;s honest face struck his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you dreaming?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t!&rsquo; retorted Davis, deeply offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where did he go then?&rsquo; demanded Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yander,&rsquo; answered &lsquo;Red.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haig was incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the truth!&rsquo; protested the boy. And then he
told Haig what he had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But how in hell&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; Haig began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suddenly it came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thunder Mountain!&rsquo; he cried. Then, half to
himself: &lsquo;The trail drops down from Thunder Mountain&ndash;&ndash;somewhere&ndash;&ndash;into
the Black Lake country, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
then&ndash;&ndash;over the Sangre de Cristo is the San Luis. <i>But
how does he know that?</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He knows a lot, he does!&rsquo; said &lsquo;Red.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Haig was off, flinging back &lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo; at
the boy. But he took the precaution to confirm &lsquo;Red&rsquo;s&rsquo;
story at the post-office. Thompson himself had seen
Sunnysides, still going like the wind. Tom Banks came
in a little later with news of the outlaw well up the road
toward Norton&rsquo;s, and Haig after him. So there&rsquo;s no
doubt the way they&rsquo;ve gone. But it&rsquo;s a losing game if
Sunnysides can keep up the speed he was hitting when
he was last seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A losing game!&rdquo; She, better than anybody else in
the Park, knew what that meant. She rose slowly, and
looked across the Park at Thunder Mountain, now lost
among the clouds. No, not quite; for through a rift she
was just able to make out the timber line on the mountain&rsquo;s
jutting shoulder. Above that she knew the bleak
rocks rose sheer to the bald head that was battered by
tempests, seared by lightning, swept smooth by the winds
that never ceased.</p>
<p>So this was the message! This was what Thunder
Mountain had said to her! This was the answer to her
questions! Day after day she had studied it, when
storms gathered on that frowning head, when vapors
made a smudge there in the midst of the glittering assemblage
of the peaks, and when, for a meager hour,
once in a while, the summit stood clear in the sunshine,
as if the tortured mountain, condemned to everlasting
punishment, had been given a brief reprieve.</p>
<p>Now, at last, she understood. Somewhere on that
evil trail was Philip. He could never cross Thunder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Mountain! Sunnysides might, perhaps; but he&ndash;&ndash;he
had tried, and failed. Others had tried, and&ndash;&ndash;died
for it. But he would try again; she knew how desperately
he would throw himself upon that fatal head.
And then? It was the end!</p>
<p>But she must know. She could not stay there.</p>
<p>She started down the hill, running; and Smythe followed
her in amazement and alarm. He did not like
that last look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he called, in a voice that for once rang with
authority.</p>
<p>She stopped, and let him overtake her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Murray&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;for news,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s necessary,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Mrs. Murray once at the post-office. She
talked to me about Murray&rsquo;s ranch&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s in a gulch
just below timber line. She asked me to come and visit
her&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go with you!&rdquo; retorted Smythe.</p>
<p>She looked at him intently, and smiled in a way that
puzzled and disturbed him. But before he could make
any considerable effort to analyze it, the smile had fled,
and he was following Marion helplessly down the hill.</p>
<p>At the steps of the veranda she paused, and waited
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be out in a minute,&rdquo; she said; and left him
seating himself uneasily, his perplexity plainly showing
in his face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>Marion opened the door, and faltered on the threshold.
Seth was there with Claire; and she must face them
both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smythe wants me to go for a ride with him,&rdquo;
she said, advancing smilingly. &ldquo;We can start to-morrow
on the shooting trip, can&rsquo;t we, Cousin Seth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not often called him &ldquo;Cousin Seth&rdquo; of late;
and he was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said reflectively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather planned
starting to-day, but if to-morrow suits you better it&rsquo;s all
right, Marion. Go along with your young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claire was studying her anxiously, and Marion hastened
to disarm her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Seth!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m not
feeling quite myself this morning&ndash;&ndash;such a night I had!
A short ride will be about all I&rsquo;m good for. I&rsquo;ll feel
better to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, dear,&rdquo; said Claire, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not be gone
long, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; was the evasive reply. &ldquo;Mr.
Smythe will take good care of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that she kissed Claire, nodded brightly to Huntington,
and hurried away. Almost running in her eagerness,
she led the way to the stable, where two horses
stood saddled, with rifles in leather cases hanging from
the saddlebows, and bundles strapped behind. Smythe
started to remove the gun from Tuesday&rsquo;s saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, leave it there!&rdquo; commanded Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. But why?&rdquo; asked Smythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It just occurred to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the bundle? You won&rsquo;t need that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No. But yes&ndash;&ndash;leave it! It&rsquo;s not very big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smythe looked at her keenly, and with a vague suspicion;
but there was no confusion in her face or manner.
She was, in fact, not thinking of the bundle or the gun;
or if she thought of them&ndash;&ndash;Such rigid instruments
as words, worn blunt with usage and misuse, are quite
inadequate to describe the faint and fugitive character
of that thought,&ndash;&ndash;the idea still in its inception, inchoate,
embryo. She was going to Murray&rsquo;s for news of
Philip Haig; and all beyond that purpose was&ndash;&ndash;beyond.</p>
<p>Smythe was not satisfied, but he could say no more;
for Marion was already mounting Tuesday, and he
could only follow.</p>
<p>At the edge of the little wood below the ranch house
Marion turned in the saddle, and saw Claire standing in
the doorway. She waved her hand, and Claire waved
hers in response; and then the trees came between them,
as they had done a hundred times that summer. But
now a lump rose in Marion&rsquo;s throat. Dear Claire!
She had been so good to her!</p>
<p>They emerged from the woods, and Marion spurred
Tuesday to the gallop, and Smythe came galloping behind.
For some distance down the valley she made a
point of keeping well ahead of him, by this means avoiding
conversation, for which she was not prepared. Her
eyes continually sought the dark, gaunt mass of rock
that was then, little by little, breaking through the reek
on Thunder Mountain. Philip would be up there soon.
He had&ndash;&ndash;how many hours the start of her? She
checked Tuesday&rsquo;s gait, and let Smythe come up beside
her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What time was it when he passed the post-office?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now it was almost noon! She spurred her pony
on.</p>
<p>They turned the corner at Thompson&rsquo;s, galloping, and
caught a glimpse of Mrs. Thompson in the doorway,
with a look of wonder on her face. Two miles beyond
they swerved without lessening their speed into a less-traveled
road that presently was winding in and out
among the timber, which opened at the end of another
mile, and showed them Norton&rsquo;s ranch in its sheltered
valley among the foothills. It was from Norton&rsquo;s, or
near it, that the last word had come of Haig and Sunnysides;
so there was no need to stop for confirmation of
their direction. The valley narrowed to a gulch, and
the forest came down on either side, and the road ahead
of them was swallowed up in shade.</p>
<p>Here, as if at the entrance to some unknown (for she
had never been past Norton&rsquo;s, in all her rides about the
Park), her purpose required that Marion should rid
herself of Smythe. Moreover, there was Claire to be
thought of; and she did not want Huntington to be
riding up the trail after her that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Smythe,&rdquo; she said, reining up in the first
shadow of the woods, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something for you to do
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to leave me now, and take a message to
Mrs. Huntington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going on alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. I&rsquo;ve got my rifle. Besides, I&rsquo;ll be
at Murray&rsquo;s before dark, and there, as you know, I shall
be in good hands. But Claire will worry unless she
knows where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll worry just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She knows Mrs. Murray very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Smythe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached her hand to him, and he took it reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all wrong, Miss Gaylord!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
convinced that I&rsquo;m acting like a fool. If anything happens
to you, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing will happen to me. Good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smythe watched her until she was swallowed up by
the woods; he looked at the pines piling up to the distant
crests of the mountains, mass on mass, and solitude
enfolding deeper solitude; he listened to the long, low,
rolling murmur of the forest, sweet but menacing.
Then, with the inward comment that he was several
kinds of a blithering idiot, he turned and rode back
toward the Park, evolving various interesting but futile
theories to explain the fact that he, a man of undoubted
intelligence, had always acted the part of the giddy fool
in moments of emergency. And there was Huntington&ndash;&ndash;another
fool! He could foresee a pretty dialogue
between them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;THE TRAIL HELD TRUE&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>The forest enveloped her, but she sheltered herself
in its heart, and was glad of its soothing
silence. The wind had died down to a rustling murmur
in the highest foliage; through rifts in the dark-green
canopy she caught glimpses of a cool blue sky;
and there was a rooty sweetness in the air.</p>
<p>Mile by mile the road, a mere track traveled by
Murray&rsquo;s team at long intervals, grew rougher and
more difficult. Soon it had abandoned the easy grades
for the gulch, and climbed steep mountain sides, in a
devious course through heavy timber, dropping to
tumbling rivulets, climbing again to hang on the edges
of high cliffs, dodging here and there among massive,
outjutting rocks. Four hours she rode thus, mounting,
ever mounting, with glimpses now and then of the
forests massed green-black below, and glimpses even of
the Park itself, around the shoulder of a hill,&ndash;&ndash;a patch
of green and violet bright with sunshine. And then,
when weariness had begun to weigh upon her, and as
the shadows of the forest turned to glooms, she saw
with a thrill of expectation that the road dipped ahead
of her into a little gulch that lay hidden away in a cleft
of the mountains. She must surely be near her destination
now; and sure enough, she was riding presently
along the bank of a roaring stream; beyond her was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
small meadow of a brilliant green, and at the far edge
of it a log cabin, with friendly smoke curling from
the chimney.</p>
<p>But she was surprised and disappointed. She had
expected, on reaching Murray&rsquo;s, to see the stark head
of Thunder Mountain towering above it, near and
sheer. It was nowhere visible; not even the silvery
peaks, its neighbors, were to be seen; there were only
forests heaped on forests to the sky line. The trail,
then, must be longer than she thought; and she seemed
to be no closer to him than when she had studied the
bald head of the mountain through the clouds.</p>
<p>She was welcomed by Mrs. Murray with cordiality,
but in some surprise. A stout and jovial person,
whose spirits appeared not to have been lowered in the
least degree by the loneliness of her surroundings, Mrs.
Murray was a helpful hostess to Marion, who was
now in a state of deep dejection. A little boy and his
smaller sister, both very dirty but rugged and red-cheeked,
played in the open space before the cabin.
The week&rsquo;s washing was on the line, and from behind
it, at the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoof beats, came Mrs. Murray,
staring in amazement. Wonders on wonders in
that solitude, where nothing ever happened! First a
runaway horse of unheard-of color, saddled and bridled,
dashing past the cabin, and almost trampling the children
at their play; then Philip Haig, with his set face
and burning eyes, making inquiries, and asking for a
bite to eat; and then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! If it ain&rsquo;t Miss Gaylord!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Murray, as she rushed to greet her. &ldquo;What in the
world&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>She paused on that, recalling suddenly what she had
heard at Thompson&rsquo;s of Marion&rsquo;s nursing Haig back to
life, and intuitively associating her appearance there
with his. Marion saw the thought reflected in the
woman&rsquo;s honest face, and knew that after all the happenings
of the summer, and the gossip that had followed,
her better course was to be frank with Mrs.
Murray from the start. Besides she could not wait to
ask her questions by any indirection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo; she demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was here&ndash;&ndash;about noontime. The look on
his face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw up her hands in a gesture that indicated
the abandonment of all hope for such a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sunnysides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long before him. The critter almost run over my
two babies, playin&rsquo; there before the door. Poor dears,
scared almost out o&rsquo; their skins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. That is, not much. About the horse
first. My man told him it ain&rsquo;t no use tryin&rsquo; to ketch
him, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s foolish to try to cross Thunder Mountain.
Murray&rsquo;s been here ten years, an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t gone much
further&rsquo;n the edge of it. Storms allus drove him back.
An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the use, when he&rsquo;s got wife an&rsquo; childer to
look after? Of course Haig&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he c&rsquo;n cross if Sunnysides can, an&rsquo; if they
can&rsquo;t they&rsquo;ll fight it out up there. My man asks why
he didn&rsquo;t go &rsquo;round a safe way an&rsquo; wait for Sunnysides
in the San Luis, if he thinks the horse&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
back home. Haig says he&rsquo;d made up his mind to cross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Thunder Mountain some time, an&rsquo; now&rsquo;s as good a
time as any. But it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She was checked at last
by the look of anguish on Marion&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But you
just come in. It&rsquo;s supper time, almost, an&rsquo; you must
be right hungry. Murray&rsquo;ll be here soon, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll
put up your horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the cabin there was to be seen at first just one big
room, with two beds at one end, a table surrounded by
chairs in the middle, and a stove in the midst of kettles
and pans and tubs at the other. But presently
Marion noticed a kind of balcony above the beds, and
she learned later that this was the &ldquo;spare bedroom&rdquo;
in which she would be stowed away for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was hungry too,&rdquo; Mrs. Murray went on, being
careful, however, to confine herself to the material side
of the subject. &ldquo;He ate some dinner, an&rsquo; then, after
we give up tryin&rsquo; to stop him, Murray said he&rsquo;d got to
take somethin&rsquo; with him to eat, an&rsquo; some blankets.
He hadn&rsquo;t a thing, mind you, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t want to take
nothin&rsquo;, but he did take a good-sized strip o&rsquo; bacon and
some bread&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d just did the bakin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; a fryin&rsquo;-pan
an&rsquo; matches an&rsquo; a knife. Murray done &rsquo;em up in a
pair o&rsquo; blankets, an&rsquo; stuck in a leather coat with sheepskin
inside, an&rsquo; hung a hatchet on his saddle. He&rsquo;ll
need &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;if he gits across into the Black Lake country,
which&rsquo;s worse some ways than Thunder Mountain&ndash;&ndash;forest&rsquo;t
ain&rsquo;t never been touched, an&rsquo; bad lands, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murray&rsquo;s entrance interrupted this speech, which
was becoming painful to her guest, in spite of the good
woman&rsquo;s resolution to say nothing discouraging. Murray,
a bearded, rough fellow in whose face shone good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
nature and contentment with the living he made out of
his cows and chickens and few head of stock feeding in
the mountain meadows, received a whispered hint, and
obediently talked of other things than Haig and the
runaway. They supped on bacon and eggs, with bread
and butter and milk; and an hour afterwards Marion
was tucked away in a comfortable bed in that queer
&ldquo;spare bedroom&rdquo; up against the eaves of the log
cabin.</p>
<p>Exhaustion soon brought her sleep. But in the
middle of the night she was awakened by a storm that
swept high over the ranch house, scarcely touching it
in its sheltered hollow, but shrieking and wailing
among the rocks and pines. She sat up in her bed to
listen! Thunder Mountain! Before her eyes there
rose, out of the dark of the cabin, a vision of Philip
prone among the rocks of that terrible summit, struck
down by the wind, or felled by a thunderbolt, drenched
with rain, and perishing of cold. There came, above
the howling of the wind, a deafening crash of thunder
that rolled away in sullen bellowing. She buried her
face among the pillows to shut out the frightful sound;
and at length, when the tumult had died away to recur
no more, she lay weeping softly until sleep came again
to her relief. She did not wake again till morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther up can I go?&rdquo; asked Marion at
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Murray in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Marion quickly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the
top. But can&rsquo;t I ride near enough to see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You c&rsquo;n go to timber line safe enough,&rdquo; said Murray.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been that far, but you mustn&rsquo;t think o&rsquo;
goin&rsquo; further,&rdquo; added the woman, still suspicious.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what! Murray&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; Marion protested. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
necessary at all. I can follow trails well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let Murray go with you. He&rsquo;ll be
glad to show you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Thank you just the same, Mrs. Murray,
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll not try to go past timber line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that, please! I know I could
never go where men have failed. I&rsquo;ve heard all about
Thunder Mountain, and I just want to see it, near.
Besides&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, but turned quickly away. This
sign of emotion was not hidden from Mrs. Murray, and
it heightened her anxiety. Lord only knew what the
girl&rsquo;d try to do once she got out of their sight! But
where the intellectual and argumentative Smythe had
failed, what could be expected of these simple mountain
folk, who for all their sturdy independence were
not a little awed by the superior poise and distinction
of their visitor? Moreover, Marion was at this moment
entirely honest in her assurance that she intended
to go no farther than timber line. If the idea
that lay deep in the back of her mind had grown since
its inception some hours before, it was yet formless and
unrecognized; if her purpose now had her firmly
gripped, she was as yet unconscious of it, obeying it
subconsciously, while she told herself, as she told Mrs.
Murray, that she wanted only to satisfy her aching
heart by doing merely all that a girl could do. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
make sure that Philip had not already failed&ndash;&ndash;that he
had not been thrown back from the very edge of the
fatal crest&ndash;&ndash;that he did not now lie somewhere on the
last steep slope above timber line, where she might see
and save him: this was the utmost of her design in
setting out that morning against the protests of her
hosts.</p>
<p>Yielding at last, where she could avail no more, the
ranchwife fixed up a simple luncheon of bread and
butter and jam, which she tied in a little package at
Marion&rsquo;s saddlebow. And then, with a final word of
warning that she must stop at timber line, an&rsquo; be back
at the house &rsquo;fore dark, or she, Mrs. Murray, would be
wild, and he, Murray, would have to go searching for
her, the good woman let her go, and waved a fat farewell
to her until Marion was out of sight among the
trees.</p>
<p>Once more the forest enfolded her. Though the
wagon road ended at Murray&rsquo;s, the trail was still for
some distance plainly marked, and offered few difficulties.
Even when it began to be less distinct she was
not alarmed. Smythe had told her, and Murray had
confirmed his description, that Thunder Mountain was
not formidable as far as the foot of the final scarp.
Seth had taught her something of the lore of trails, and
she was confident that she would be able to find her way
even if the underfoot marks should fail. There would
be blazes on trees, and broken limbs and twigs, and
many subtle signs that she now sought to marshal in
her mind against a possible perplexity. With eyes
alert, she rode slowly and resolutely on, ever higher
and higher, hour after hour, most of the time through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
dense woods, but now and then across a rocky slope, or
down into a shallow gulch, and out again. By imperceptible
degrees the trail grew fainter; and once it
failed her utterly, in a small open space in the woods.</p>
<p>For a moment she was on the very point of panic;
the forest seemed to be closing in on her with sudden
malignity; and the terror of Thunder Mountain held
her in its cold grip. But desperation called up her
courage. She walked Tuesday in an ever-widening
circle around the spot where she had lost the trail, with
her heart almost still, and her eyes straining at every
tree as it came within her vision. Where? Where?
Would there be no more blazes, no more broken limbs,
no more prints of hoofs on the mossy earth? Had she
left the trail farther back than she had thought? And
would she wander over all the vast bosom of the mountain
until she fell from the saddle, and knew no more?</p>
<p>It was a real peril, and one that might have had a
tragic termination as easily as a happy one,&ndash;&ndash;more
easily, indeed, if she had lost her head. But something
strong within her kept her senses keen; and suddenly
she broke out in a cry of joy and triumph that
went echoing down the forest aisles. There, on a
patriarchal pine, though almost obliterated by time and
weather, was the blaze in the bark that told her the
trail ran at the base of that solid trunk. She halted
Tuesday there&ndash;&ndash;and faced a new difficulty: in her
many circlings she had lost the general direction in
which she had been riding. The trail was under her
horse&rsquo;s hoofs; but which way should she go? There
appeared to be no ascent the one way or the other, and
no slope on either side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>She solved the problem by following the trail regardless
of direction until she was able to discover in
the black mold the fresh print of a horse&rsquo;s hoof&ndash;&ndash;an
unshod hoof this was, and the print certainly no older
than yesterday. Without serious misgivings now, she
rode on, and in a few minutes the trail mounted again
with a sharpness sufficient to remove the last of her
doubts.</p>
<p>Well, she was a woodsman now, and would fear no
more. But she took the precaution to banish all
thoughts excepting those necessary to the task in hand.
The woods themselves offered countless temptations to
distraction. They were alive. Grouse moved among
the branches of the trees; small birds of a very silent
habit fluttered across the trail; and once a deer slipped
away through a dim and leafy avenue. In moist
places flowers of tender hues still bloomed as if to shame
the autumn browns of the underbrush. And then she
emerged from the soft shades of the green woods into
one of the most melancholy of mountain places, a great
patch of burnt timber. For surely half an hour she
rode through a veritable cemetery of pines, among multitudes
of tall straight shafts from which the flames
had licked the foliage and stripped the limbs, and from
which the rains and snows and winds of winter had
washed the charred bark until the boles stood white and
ghastly, infinitely sad and still. No life was here, no
flutter or call or hum of living creatures; and the
silence was like a menace. She began to cast apprehensive
glances around her, and was glad to the very
core of her when the forest gradually greened again,
and she was in the cool and friendly shade.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>Yet another terrifying experience awaited her,&ndash;&ndash;not
terrifying in the sense of any peril to herself so
much as in its vivid suggestion of peril to Philip Haig.
Without warning there came a prodigious crash of
thunder; very near, it seemed. The whole earth
rocked and shook, she fancied, under that smashing
blow, and thereupon a savage bellowing filled the vault
of heaven, and the forest quivered with the reverberations.
Hard on the first blow fell another; and then
the strokes descended in a swift and terrible succession,
until there was one continuous and deafening
roar like nothing she had ever heard or imagined. By
this she knew that she was now close up under the
frowning battlement of Thunder Mountain; and that a
storm had burst upon that shelterless and unpitied head,
with a malevolent timeliness befitting its ill repute.
And somewhere in the midst of that destroying fury
was Philip Haig!</p>
<p>The blue tracery of sky was blotted out; the forest
became dark as night; the tree tops heaved and thrashed
about in the wind that rushed down the mountain side.
On the heels of the wind came a drenching rain, and
Marion took what refuge was offered close to the trunk
of a huge pine, which shook and shivered as if it too
had nerves that were unstrung by all this tumult.</p>
<p>It passed, and the sky cleared with what to her seemed
extraordinary swiftness. And when she rode out again
to pick up the trail, the air was indescribably fresh and
exhilarating, and the sun was soon filtering through the
foliage upon her pathway.</p>
<p>The trail grew more precipitous, its surroundings
more rugged and wild. Rocks took the place of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
soft, mossy soil, and the forest thinned and shrank.
Where there had been monarchs in their majesty she
rode now among stunted pines and dwarf oaks no
higher than her head. And soon she was at timber
line, where the beaten and disheartened trees grew
downward, or curled along the earth like serpents, or
spread out in fantastic, unnatural, and monstrous
shapes.</p>
<p>And there at last towered the bald head of Thunder
Mountain. She could not see, of course, the flat top
itself. Before her rose a precipitous slope, covered
with loose stones and d&eacute;bris, and ending in a jagged
line of rock against the sky, dull gray against the blue.
Thin grass grew yet some distance up the slope; and
then it was bare of vegetation, bare of soil, with a
wavering faint line marking where life ended and death
began.</p>
<p>She halted near the last gnome-tree, and stared at
the desolate slope and the forbidding sky line. This
was the end of her journey; and she knew no more than
she could have known back there in the Park. The
mountain was still the sphinx, telling her nothing,
though she had come to it at last after months of questioning,
with one question on her lips. Where was
Philip? Perhaps just yonder, just beyond that sharp-raised
barrier. From that crest, no doubt, the whole
expanse of the summit would be visible. And how
could she go back alone, without being able to assure
herself forever that she had done her best?</p>
<p>She studied the slope. From where she stood to the
gray sky line the distance was perhaps seven hundred
feet. But the trail, which she could discern faintly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
marked among the loose and sliding stones, traveled
five or six times that distance in its zigzag course.
Fascinated, her eyes followed it in and out until its
dim line vanished high up in the gray-brown uniformity
of the steep ascent. From this she looked up
eagerly at the sky. It was a clear steel-blue; the sun
shone bright on the expanse of stone; a vigorous but
not violent breeze came from around the distant curve
of the slope. It seemed incredible, considering all
that she had heard, and all that she had imagined.
The mountain, she knew, had its brief and infrequent
hours of quiet, but she had pictured it as terrifying
even in its calm. Now it was formidable and mysterious,
and she could not forget its menace; but it was
not terrible. On top, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She urged Tuesday forward. The trail went far
out to the right at an easy gradient, turned sharply,
and came back to reach out as far to the left. It was
more difficult than Marion had imagined, for the reason
that the loose stones afforded an ill footing for the
pony, which slipped and slid and stumbled, often going
to his knees, and more than once barely avoiding a fall
that would have sent horse and rider rolling down to
be caught by the network of stunted trees. But Tuesday
was sure of foot; and so, with muscles quivering
under the strain, and his eyes bulging with anxiety
and fear, he climbed up and up without disaster, while
Marion leaned far forward in the saddle, her nerves
on edge, her eyes alert, and her heart pounding wildly,
as much from excitement as from its struggle with that
high altitude.</p>
<p>How long that climb endured she never knew; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
actual minutes seemed to her as hours, their total an
eternity. But at last, trembling and sweating, Tuesday
stood on a narrow shelf of granite, with the long
slope behind, and a wall of rock ahead. While the
pony rested, Marion looked to left and right for the
continuation of the trail. She could not see it, but
knew there should be an opening somewhere in the wall
that rose sheer some twenty-five or thirty feet above
her head. Slowly riding along the platform, searching
for a sign, the wall at her left, and the declivity at
her right, she came to a place where the barrier curved
inward, and was also hollowed out at its base, so that a
shallow cave (speaking loosely) was formed, where
some sort of shelter might have been found from a
storm. This possibility flashed into Marion&rsquo;s mind,
for she could not forget the mountain and its ways.
She dismounted to look into the cave, and at two steps
started forward with a cry.</p>
<p>On the rocky floor was a small heap of ashes and
charred ends of sticks. Kneeling quickly, she tore off
a glove, and thrust her fingers into the ashes. They
were warm! And near the ashes she discovered the
rind of a thin slice of bacon, and a few crumbs of
bread. Philip had passed Murray&rsquo;s soon after midday;
he would have reached the cave, then, before
night; and so he had slept there, and risen at dawn,
and eaten his meagre breakfast, and ridden on.</p>
<p>She leaped to her feet, ran out and mounted her
pony, and rode forward along the platform, searching
for the trail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>IN THE HOLLOW OF THE STORM</h3>
</div>
<p>Haig arrived at timber line about an hour before
nightfall. On the long trail he had considered
thoroughly all the chances of his case, and was prepared
to undergo delays and disappointments. He
knew Thunder Mountain. Even without reckoning on
storms (and the vapors were at that moment settling
down on the frowning battlement), it were foolhardiness,
or worse, to attempt the passage of the mountain
in the night. Then he remembered the shallow cave
that he had noticed on his previous visit to the summit;
and his plans were made.</p>
<p>He gathered an armful of dry sticks and shreds of
bark, climbed the treacherous slope as Marion did some
hours later, and settled himself in the half-shelter of
the cave to await the morning. A rasher of bacon, a
slice of bread, and a pipe of tobacco refreshed him;
and he rolled himself in his blankets, and went to sleep.
Like Marion in the &ldquo;spare bedroom&rdquo; far below, he
was awakened in the night by the savage hammerings
of the storm. The very rocks beneath him seemed to
be jarred by that cannonade; the wind, howling around
the cliff, threatened to drag him out of his cave; and
the rain fell in torrents on the platform, almost flooding
his stone bed. But he turned over in his blankets,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
and hoped the mountain would &ldquo;keep it up&rdquo; all night.
Even Sunnysides would be halted by a storm like that.</p>
<p>He arose at the first sign of dawn, hurried through
his scant and salty breakfast, quenched his thirst with
rain water scooped out of depressions in the rock, and
started on. Knowing the trail at this point, he rode
straight out along the platform, and came in half a
minute to the spot where the wall of rock was broken
down into a clutter of d&eacute;bris, in width some forty feet.
Up through this litter of disintegrated granite the trail
lurched with many twists and turns, and emerged at
last upon one of the lower levels of the summit.</p>
<p>Trixy was winded, and for a moment Haig rested
her, while he surveyed the scene. And in the thrill of
that moment, facing the undertaking in which he had
once failed, he all but forgot Sunnysides. The wind
was low, and scarcely more difficult to meet than a stiff
blow in the Park; but aside from that he saw little encouraging
in the prospect. Behind him, it was true,
the forests and all the hills and valleys lay clear in the
morning light, with just a thin mist clinging in the
gulches; and around him on all sides but one the sharp
peaks stood up shining white in the first rays of the
sun. But in front of him gray vapors, not yet dense
enough to be described as clouds, came swirling and
tumbling toward him across the stone-littered surface
of the flat. Unless the sun should dissipate those
vapors&ndash;&ndash;He shrugged his shoulders, and rode on.</p>
<p>Almost fourteen thousand feet above the level of the
sea, the bald head of Thunder Mountain, stripped as it
has been of its ennobling peak, needs only three or four
hundred feet to be as high as the snow-clad summits on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
each side. Seen from afar, that bare head appears to
be as flat and smooth as a table, but in reality its entire
area, roughly circular in outline, and something more
than three miles in its largest diameter, is broken up
into terraces, into slopes and hillocks, into hollows and
mounds, all strewn with, bowlders and loose stones, with
here and there uprearing rocks of fantastic and suggestive
shapes. There is no life there,&ndash;&ndash;no birds, no
conies or chipmunks that inhabit most high places of
these mountains; no flowers, no grass, no sign of vegetation;
nothing but granite. The trail runs sometimes
plainly across level reaches of loose stones, sometimes
over long smooth surfaces of rock, sometimes in and out
among wildernesses of shattered and tumbled fragments
of the mountain&rsquo;s blasted head. At varying intervals,
particularly in its more difficult stages, it is marked by
small pyramids of stones, and by crosses cut crudely in
the rock. Care must be taken not to miss one of these
marks; for the trail, in avoiding inaccessible heaps of
granite, goes in places perilously near the edge of the
summit, which falls away in more than one known
precipice a thousand feet to the unknown gulch below.</p>
<p>The wind was cold, and Haig felt that its strength
was steadily increasing, though it yet blew fitfully.
He made the second level without mishap, but was
brought to a momentary standstill there by the fiercer
rush of wind on the higher terrace. It seemed strange,
at first thought, that the wind had not blown away the
vapors that now enveloped him; but he saw presently
that it was not blowing across the mountain, but rather
in a circular, whirlwind motion that gradually became
more violent. The terrace he now crossed was as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
smooth as a floor, and he found his way only by means
of the crosses carved in the rocks beneath his feet.
Then the trail dropped suddenly into a shallow trough;
mounted to another field of crumbled stones; and rose
unevenly to a barrier that he remembered with a pang
of chagrin. This was what at the first glance would
have appeared to be a solid and insurmountable wall of
rock, perhaps fifteen feet in height, and stretching
away to the very edge of the plateau at his right, and to
a wilderness of granite on the left. But directly ahead
of him the wall was cleft, and there was a narrow pathway
climbing up between two huge rocks that had been
carved by the elements into shapes bearing a fanciful
resemblance to human figures. These were the Twin
Sisters.</p>
<p>Here Haig had been caught by a storm that hurled
him back defeated; and he had, moreover, narrowly
escaped a worse thing than mere defeat; for the wind
had carried him off the trail, and almost to the brink
of the chasm that yawned some hundred yards away.
Now, remembering that experience, he spurred Trixy
forward to take the aperture in the wall before the
wind should suddenly become insupportable; and this
time he was more fortunate. The pony leaped and
clambered up the slippery path, and at the exit was
caught by a blast that hurled and pinned her, as if she
had been no heavier than a butterfly, against the base
of the righthand towering figure. For some seconds
neither horse nor man was able to move from that fixed
position, where the wind flattened them against the
rock. Then it swerved sharply, flung them against
the other Sister with such force that Haig&rsquo;s leg was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
stunned and bruised, and finally released them with a
shriek that sounded like a cry of disappointed rage.
Trixy plunged forward with a snort, and Haig saw that
the trail was again plain across another field of scattered
stones.</p>
<p>Now, thrilled by this victory, he urged the pony onward
at all possible speed toward the worst of all the
perils of the mountain. The stone field was succeeded
by a series of mounds and hollows, and this by a second
slippery floor; and then he mounted the ridge that terminated
in the Devil&rsquo;s Chair. Here was the highest
point attained by the trail: a flat rock measuring perhaps
twenty yards one way, and a little less the other,
lifted high above the surrounding slopes, and having
(hence its name) a huge back formed by the abrupt
termination of the ridge. From the chair the rock
dipped in a kind of hollow like a chute, worn smooth
by the winds and rains; and everything that ever fell
into that chute was swallowed by the chasm of unplumbed
and unestimated depth. Sometimes the wind
blew up through the chute across the Devil&rsquo;s Chair;
sometimes it blew down through it into the chasm. It
was blowing out when Parker reached the chair, and
he was hurled back down, the slope three times before
he acknowledged his defeat; it was blowing in when the
three members of the English party were sucked down
into the chasm.</p>
<p>Haig could have cried aloud the joy that ran through
him, when, having spurred Trixy up the steep ascent
to a footing on the Devil&rsquo;s Chair, he found that almost
a perfect calm reigned there, due to some sudden shift
in the currents of the air.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Trixy! On!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The horse bounded across the platform, slid and
stumbled down the other side, and was up again, leaping
forward, and a little to the left, where there was
firmer going over another field of stones. And now at
length, to Haig&rsquo;s relief, the trail bent sharply in toward
the middle of the plateau, and thus away from
the peril of the chasms.</p>
<p>But his elation was short-lived. If Thunder Mountain
had admitted him between the Twin Sisters, and
spared him at the Devil&rsquo;s Chair, it was only to hurl
upon him its accumulated fury farther on. Engrossed
in the endless difficulties of the trail, he had not observed
the stealthy and insidious change that was taking
place in the atmosphere until it had advanced far
toward its climax. The un-looked for calm, so opportune,
was but a pause before an outburst of elemental
rage. The vapors lifted, and hung in still masses a
few feet above the earth. Haig picked his way along
in a strange, weird, yellowish light, in a stillness that
was all the more impressive by contrast with the recent
howling and hammering of the wind. There was not
a faintest puff of air on his cheek, and not a sound
except the click of Trixy&rsquo;s feet among the stones, and
his own hurried breathing. All else seemed to have
paused, expectant, waiting.</p>
<p>It did not come as storms come in the valley, or on
the plain, or among the hills; not even as they come in
the mountains. It did not come from north, or east,
or west, or south, or from any known horizon; it had
no sensible direction; it was there. Out of the portentous
hush (not into it) there came first a whisper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
something low and malevolent; then a singular moaning
sound, incomparably dismal and hollow and pervasive.
Haig moved his head from side to side, endeavoring
to trace it&ndash;&ndash;before, behind, above&ndash;&ndash;he
knew not where. The moaning murmur grew, and still
there was no perceptible movement in the air; it rose
whining up, up, up the scale until at last it was a shrill,
demoniacal shriek. And then, out of the darkening
mists, it leaped upon him.</p>
<p>In this whirling, wicked, wondrous thing there was
no orderly and recognizable succession of phenomena,
such as wind and lightning and rain. These came all
in one swoop, all in one frightful blend. It was black,
and it was bright. The lightning came not from the
sky, discharging its bolts to earth; it was on the very
surface of the plateau. It flamed and crackled on uplifted
rocks; it ran hissing like fiery serpents among
the scattered stones; it buzzed and exploded in the
very face of Haig, and under the pony&rsquo;s belly. If he
had been caught in a burning storehouse of fireworks&ndash;&ndash;rockets,
Roman candles, pinwheels, and all the ingenious
products of the pyrotechnician&ndash;&ndash;the experience
might have been like this, only a thousand times less
terrifying. He dodged and ducked, and threw up his
hands to shield his face, expecting instantly that one of
those exploding things would make an end of him.</p>
<p>Then there were other horrors to be endured. The
din became incessant. Simultaneous with the hiss and
crackle and crack of the lightning there was a continuous
deafening detonation in the air above him, crash
on crash and roar on roar. The terrors of the first
few seconds had been chiefly those felt and heard. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
the wind had steadily increased in violence. It did
not blow against him, bowling him over, but whirled
around him with a speed that was every instant accelerated.
He felt that he had no weight. He seemed
about to be lifted into the vortex of the storm, to be
flung far out into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, girl! Down!&rdquo; he tried to shout.</p>
<p>But there was no sound from his lips. He felt the
pony stiffening under him, bracing herself stiff-legged
on the stones; and he knew that she shared his fear.
And all this time the rain beat down upon him, in
lead-like sheets, with intermittent bombardments of
hailstones. It occurred to him to wonder dully which
would win&ndash;&ndash;the wind that sought to whirl him up
into the sky, or the rain that was for beating him to
earth, or the lightning that would burn him to cinders.
Then thought left him, and his last impression was of
being torn limb from limb, and atom from atom, in
excruciating pain.</p>
<p>He was roused at length to the consciousness of having
been lifted and hurled; and found himself prostrate
on the ground, face downward, with the rain
flooding him. Trixy lay at his side, flat like himself,
her head stretched out among the stones. They seemed
to lie in a vacuum, in the very hollow of the storm.
Around them the clatter, the clang and the uproar
were even more terrifying than before because they
were now separated from these noises, no longer a part
of them. All was blackness, shot through with fire.
Haig was no more tortured in his body, except for the
sense of being suffocated. He seemed to inhale raw
ozone; the air fairly stank with the odors of decomposition;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the saliva in his mouth had a peculiar pungent
and disagreeable taste. He gasped and fought
for breath.</p>
<p>Such reason as was left to him told him that this
was the end of all. At any instant something would
flash out of that wall of blackness, and destroy him
with a blow. His spirit rose exultantly to meet and
welcome it; he rejoiced in such a death, slain by the
elements, on the roof of the world, alone, unseen; it
was a glorious exit, the finish he had sought for years
on years, his heart&rsquo;s desire. Triumphant and defiant,
he tried to roar back at the thunder, to outscream the
wind, to face the lightning with undimmed eyes.</p>
<p>There came a blinding flash, exceeding in brightness
anything he had yet experienced. But with it, to his
amazement, there emerged from the blackness a vision
that brought life back to him with a shocking thrill.
For there, not ten paces distant, was Sunnysides.
Only for an instant; and then all was again obscure.
He must have been mistaken. It was only a figment of
fancy, a creation of his tortured brain, a phenomenon
associated with his passing from life to death. And
yet he waited, staring into the smothering void.</p>
<p>Another flash of fire across the black&ndash;&ndash;and Sunnysides!
But now the lightning, as if directed by some
intelligence, became again continuous, its flashes joined
in one spouting flame. And in the very midst of it
stood the outlaw in his familiar attitude, with one forefoot
slightly raised, his head high, his nostrils distended,
his dark eyes filled with fire. There had never
been anything so bright and beautiful. His golden
hide gleamed with planetary splendor, like the mythical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
horses of the sun. This was The Horse, the golden
epiphany of the brute, the answer to all of Haig&rsquo;s fears
and resolutions. And in the very hour of his exit&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Rage rose again within him. Instinctively, for he
was scarce capable of thought, he tried to reach his revolver.
But his arms were leaden. His fingers
touched the butt of the weapon, and stopped as if paralyzed.
The horse wavered and danced before his eyes;
there was a culminating detonation; he felt a terrific
blow on his head. And he knew no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE NARROW PASSAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>Light came with unutterable mystery. Yet Haig
lay for a moment waiting, mistrustful of the
peace that encompassed him. Then he cautiously
raised his head, and looked. Trixy stood near him,
panting and wild-eyed. The whole surface of the
plateau was glistening wet; a cold breeze poured over
him, without violence; and the sky above him was as
innocent and bright as a baby&rsquo;s smile.</p>
<p>Where, then, was the storm? He moved his head
painfully, and searched the horizon; and yonder,
around the icy parapets of Silver Tip, with roll on roll
of reverberations in its wake, the black storm was in
full flight. His eyes followed it with a curious and
exaggerated interest; for he had seen its birth, and
tested its power, and it had given him a new experience.</p>
<p>Presently he tried to rise, and found that his limbs
were numb. His right arm ached to the tips of his
fingers. His head swam, and he had difficulty in arranging
his impressions in any sort of orderly succession,
especially those in which Sunnysides participated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how much of it really happened!&rdquo; he
mused.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly his eyes lighted on his revolver, where
it lay among the stones at his side. Ah! It had
burned his fingers. He picked it up, and examined it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
curiously. But none of the cartridges had been exploded.
The gun, then, had been knocked out of his
hand before he could lift and aim it; and the storm
had taunted him with Sunnysides, and cheated him.
No matter! The game was not yet up.</p>
<p>He struggled to his feet, and stretched himself, and
pounded his chest, which ached from his heavy breathing.
Then his eyes sought the trail ahead, scanning
the level spaces and the heaped-up masses of granite;
and an instant later a cry escaped his lips. For there,
perhaps half a mile away, and mounting rapidly a gray
ridge of rock, his body outlined against the blue sky,
was Sunnysides. It had been no vision, then, no figment
of his tortured brain. But where had the horse
been all this time, to have been caught in the same storm
with his pursuer, despite his half-hour start, his greater
speed, and the night that came between them? True,
there had been a storm in the night; that might have
delayed, but it should not have kept him. True, too,
he might have lost the trail, and wandered over the
plateau; but Haig could not have missed him, if he had
been anywhere in sight before the storm revealed him.
No, nothing could explain it; and there remained only
one hypothesis, which was untenable, preposterous and
mad. And yet it fascinated and held him. He had
once said jocularly that Sunnysides was not a real horse
at all; that he was a demon&ndash;&ndash;a spirit. Well, it was a
real horse, right enough, that had crushed him, and
thrown him again, and broken Bill Craven&rsquo;s leg, and
fled; and that was a real horse yonder, outlined against
the sky. If some devilish instinct in the brute, or
some agent of Destiny, or mere fling of chance had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
held him on the plateau to tantalize and lead on his
pursuer&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreaming again!&rdquo; Haig muttered, with a wry
smile, and yet with a vague uneasiness that he could
not put down.</p>
<p>But in another instant he had leaped to his horse,
tested the cinches with trembling fingers, climbed stiffly
into the saddle, and dug the spurs into Trixy&rsquo;s flanks.
When he looked again toward the ridge, the outlaw had
disappeared; but there was no ignis-fatuus trick in
that; and the horse would be seen again when Haig
too had topped the rise. For the trail was now leading
him in a relatively straight line toward the exact
spot where Sunnysides had vanished; and more assuring
than all else, a very material and comforting proof
that this was a real horse he followed, was the discovery
he made halfway up the slope. There, among the
stones, lay the outlaw&rsquo;s saddle. Clearly the runaway
had only just now been able to shake it off, and its condition,
bruised and cut and dirty, showed that Sunnysides
had been put to some trouble to be rid of it, having
doubtless rolled over and over on it in his efforts to be
free. And there, too, was a plausible explanation of
the fact that Sunnysides was not now far on the trail.</p>
<p>From the top of the ridge, Haig saw the outlaw picking
his way through a wilderness of rocks that had the
grewsome aspect of a cemetery&ndash;&ndash;the graveyard of the
gods. Following through this depressing scene, he lost
sight of Sunnysides, and on emerging upon another
floor-like expanse of solid stone he received a surprise
that caused him to rein up Trixy with a jerk. The
quarry was nowhere in sight, though Haig&rsquo;s position
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
gave him a sweeping view of the flat ahead of him, even
to the edge of the summit, now scarcely three quarters
of a mile away. There was no possibility that the
horse could have traversed that distance in the time
Haig was passing through the &ldquo;cemetery;&rdquo; neither
was there any place on that part of the plateau where it
could be concealed.</p>
<p>The trail itself solved the mystery. It did not lead
straight on, as Haig had imagined; and he experienced
some difficulty in finding it on the smooth floor, from
which the elements had all but obliterated the crosses
made by the pioneers. Then his astonishment was
great to find that it turned at a sharp angle to the left,
dropped sheer over the edge of the flat rock, coiled down
a slope littered with d&eacute;bris to another field of loose
stones, and in a quarter of a mile brought up at the
brink of a cliff. Sunnysides, then, had crossed the
summit, and was descending to whatever lay below.</p>
<p>In ten minutes Haig himself was at the margin of
the chasm; for little wider than a chasm was that deep
and narrow gulch, far up the side of Thunder Mountain,
into which he now looked in wonderment and perplexity.
A thousand feet or more below him lay a
tiny patch of meadow of a brilliant green, with a thread
of water sparkling through it, and on all sides, excepting
that nearest him, black forests encompassed it, and
mounted dense to the timber line save where, at his
right, the stream ran down through its gorge. There,
evidently, would go the trail also, dropping into the
Black Lake country, of evil reputation.</p>
<p>But where now was the trail? He dismounted, and
leaned over the edge of the precipice; and there he discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
that he had missed the exact point of departure
by some fifteen yards, and that at this distance to his
left there was a break in the sharp brink, where the
trail fell off precipitately to a heap of broken stone
and sand. The cliff had been shattered in some convulsion
of nature, or loosened and disintegrated by the
elements, and enormous masses of it had fallen into the
gulch. These masses appeared to be in a state of instability,
and it was not clear to Haig, from where he
lay, how a trail could ever have been picked out among
those jutting rocks and slides of d&eacute;bris, or how, once
found, it could have remained intact on that shifting
foundation. Was it possible that any living thing had
ever made its way down (much less <i>up</i>) that steep and
treacherous rubble heap?</p>
<p>He was studying it incredulously, when Sunnysides
suddenly resolved all doubts. From behind a projecting
rock the horse came out on one of the many
rough ledges that had been formed by lateral cleavage of
the cliff in its fall. Hesitating a moment there, he
plunged down a short declivity, and landed sprawling
on another shelf perhaps twenty feet lower down, and
somewhat to the right of the first, where he once more
vanished from Haig&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried Haig. &ldquo;If you can do that we
can. Eh, Trixy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mounted quickly, urged the reluctant mare to the
break in the edge of the cliff, and forced her over. For
some thirty feet the trail went down the face of the
precipice, much like a fire escape on the wall of a tenement
house, barely wide enough to accommodate horse
and rider,&ndash;&ndash;so narrow, indeed, that Haig&rsquo;s left leg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
was scraped and bruised by hard contact with the stone.
At the bottom of this incline, his amazement was great
at finding a solid platform of rock, on which, he was
able easily to turn and go down another incline underneath
the first. Plainly all this was not the result of
accident; the hands of men had been busy here; and
picks and shovels had supplemented the work of nature.
But below the next platform there certainly had been a
secondary slide of rock, for the trail was nowhere discernible,
though it should evidently have slipped down,
at a greater angle from the cliff than before, to a third
turning point on a shelf some forty feet away to the
left. Here the d&eacute;bris was loose and fine, and with a
little urging Trixy was induced to take the descent,
carrying quantities of sand and stones with her as she
slid and sprawled safely to the next goal.</p>
<p>Thus they went, sometimes finding the trail plain
over solid rock and hard-packed d&eacute;bris, sometimes slipping
and scrambling among stones and sand, but always
drawing nearer and nearer in a zigzag course,
now easy and then difficult, to the green vale below.
There were moments when Trixy was on her knees,
moments when she was on her haunches, moments when
she stood swaying above the pit, and moments when all
traces of the trail had vanished. But somewhere below
was Sunnysides.</p>
<p>Far down the declivity, so near the valley that Haig
was able to look across into the tops of the tallest pines,
they came to what appeared to be the last of the rocky
ledges. Having for some minutes seen nothing of the
outlaw, Haig supposed that the runaway had already
reached the meadow, and was by now on the trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
through the forest. But just as Trixy&rsquo;s shod hoofs
struck the platform with a clatter, Haig caught sight of
Sunnysides far out on the narrow shelf. He was trotting
briskly along, for the shelf was smooth and level.
But, on a sudden he stopped, stood a moment with his
head thrust forward and down, and then turned cautiously
around, his four feet bunched together on the
narrow footing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; ejaculated Haig.</p>
<p>And then he saw it. Twice before he had noted
where a similar error might have been made, on other
ledges farther up; and he himself had avoided them
only by carefully studying the aspect of the declivity
below him. Sunnysides had undoubtedly lost time
through such mistakes; and now he was trapped. At
the point where he stood, the shelf ended abruptly &ldquo;in
the air&rdquo;; and between him and the exit at the other
end of the platform was Haig. The trail had come
down to about the middle of this platform, which was
like an unrailed balcony, scarce three feet in width,
with a high wall of rock on one side, and on the other
a straight drop of twenty feet to a veritable chute of
stones that terminated in a widespread litter of d&eacute;bris
on the meadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught like a rat!&rdquo; cried Haig. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what could he do with him? His rope was useless
on that meager footing, where there was barely
room for his horse to stand, much less for Haig to swing
a noose. And worse: if Sunnysides was trapped, so
was his enemy; for the horse was already, through
fright or belligerency, moving slowly toward Haig. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
a flash it was clear to Haig that the outlaw meant to
have it out with him then and there; and that there
would be no time to turn Trixy, and find the outlet into
the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew his revolver, and waited. There was yet a
chance, he thought, or hoped, that the horse would halt,
and postpone the issue. He did not want to kill him;
he had not come across Thunder Mountain to kill him;
he had come to take him back to Paradise Park. And
so he waited&ndash;&ndash;fatally. The outlaw came slowly until
half the space between him and Haig had been covered.
Then, at a distance of perhaps a hundred feet,
when no choice was left to him, Haig swung up his
gun, and fired. At that very instant, Sunnysides uttered
a savage cry, a shrill neigh ending in a scream;
and, charged at the horse and rider in his path.</p>
<p>Haig fired again, and missed; threw himself forward
on Trixy&rsquo;s neck, jerked the pony&rsquo;s head in toward
the wall, and fired again; and missed. He tried to
shoot once more, into the very face of the oncoming
brute, but too late. There was a vision of flaming
black eyes and white teeth, in a yellow blur; and then
a tremendous impact, a crash. Trixy was flung back
on her haunches, with one hind leg over the edge of the
shelf, Haig barely hanging in the saddle. The outlaw
leaped back, and lunged again; thrust himself between
Trixy and the wall; toppled pony and rider off into
the void; and passed on, with a shriek of triumphant
rage.</p>
<p>Haig and Trixy turned in the air, struck the chute
of stones and sand, and rolled over and over as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
went down in a flying slide of d&eacute;bris. But Haig did
not know that, for his head struck a stone at the first
contact with the chute.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Sentience returned to him through mists of pain.
He lay in a twisted heap on a patch of grass, surrounded
by the scattered detritus of the cliff. At first
he could not remember, and could not see. His head
rang with pain, and his eyes were filled with dust, and
with something wet. He managed presently to lift an
arm and wipe his eyes with his hand; and saw dimly
that the hand was covered with blood. His eyes then
filled again; and he swept his sleeves across them and
his forehead. That was better. Blinking, and wiping
his face again and again, he looked dully around him
until memory came back, and brought recognition of
his plight.</p>
<p>He tried to sit up, but sank down quickly with a
groan. One leg was bent almost double under the
other, and would not move. This fact struck him at
first as very queer&ndash;&ndash;an inexplicable phenomenon.
Then he tried it again. His left leg moved at his will,
and that encouraged him. His right hip and part of
the thigh too moved, but the leg below lay loose and
dead.</p>
<p>The blood was in his eyes again. It exasperated
him; he could do nothing unless he were able to see.
He wiped his face again with his sleeve, then put his
hand to his head, and winced a little as the fingers
touched a gash just above the left temple, from which
the blood still flowed. By turning his head he found
that the blood ran down away from his eyes instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
into them. The new position also gave him a view of
several things that held his attention.</p>
<p>First there was the clutter of stones around him.
Then his eyes swept upward to the ledge whence he had
come rolling down&ndash;&ndash;how far? He calculated the distance
curiously. Eighty feet&ndash;&ndash;a hundred, surely.
How did he come to be still alive? he wondered. And
Trixy! Where was she.</p>
<p>Once more he tackled the problem of sitting up, and
it became easier now in his full understanding of his
condition. By ignoring the dead leg entirely, since it
was of no further use to him, he contrived to raise himself
with his hands on the ground behind him for support.
Then with a jerk that brought a cry of pain, he
sat erect, swaying but resolute. At this instant he
heard a soft whinny behind him. Twisting himself
around, he saw Trixy lying some twenty feet away,
with her forelegs doubled up beneath her, and her head
lifted and pointed toward him. He studied the little
mare a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixy! Get up!&rdquo; he commanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>She lifted her head higher, made a desperate effort
to rise, sank back, and whinnied piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! Yours too, eh! Nice fix, Trixy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He surveyed the scene. They were in a bright green
meadow about two hundred yards in width and perhaps
half a mile in length. Across the meadow from where
he lay the black forest mounted toward the sky. At
one end the vale narrowed into a mere ravine, which
vanished upward in deep woods; at the other it widened
to the forest, and by the way the pine-masses came
down to this spot from both sides he knew that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the trail ran down the mountain toward the Black Lake
country. The vale was very still under the bright
blue sky; there was just a murmur in the forest; and
no sound of birds came to his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful site&ndash;&ndash;for a graveyard!&rdquo; he said
aloud, and smiled.</p>
<p>The blood still trickled into his eyes, and annoyed
him greatly. It must be stopped, or he could do nothing
that needed to be done. In an inside pocket of his
coat he found a handkerchief, which he bound around
his head, after he had wiped his face once more. The
pain in his head had subsided to a dull throbbing, which
did not matter. But&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God! I&rsquo;m thirsty!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>He looked again across the meadow. The thread of
water that he had seen from the top of the cliff was
a considerable brook that ran silently through about
the middle of the green. He measured the distance,&ndash;&ndash;fifty
or sixty yards, maybe seventy, or more. He could
do it, by dragging himself along the ground, he thought.
But was it worth the effort, and the pain? It would
hurt him like the devil&ndash;&ndash;that broken leg. Never did
like pain; would probably howl; and that would not be
nice, even with no creature but Trixy to hear him.
No; he would stay where he was. Then suddenly he
thought of Pete&rsquo;s whisky, and thrust his hand into his
pocket, only to encounter fragments of glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lesson,&rdquo; he thought grimly. &ldquo;Never
carry whisky in glass bottles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now his roving eyes lighted once more on Trixy.
No good letting her suffer. He would send her away
first. On the thought, his hand went back to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
holster at his hip; and stayed there, while his heart
stood still, and a chill went over him, and thought
ceased. The holster was empty.</p>
<p>After a while he was able to think about it. One of
two things would happen to him. There were, very
probably, mountain lions in those forests. But they
were not the worst thing he faced. To be eaten were
perhaps preferable to dying little by little, of hunger
and thirst. He had been near starvation, twice in his
life; and once he had been thirsty,&ndash;&ndash;that is to say,
<i>thirsty</i>,&ndash;&ndash;and God save him from dying of thirst!
But wait! He hesitated; then held his breath; and in
a total suspension of thought slowly reached his hand
down into a side pocket of his trousers. And then he
almost yelled aloud for joy. His pocketknife was
there!</p>
<p>Meanwhile&ndash;&ndash;Trixy. It was cruel not to be able to
end her suffering. What had become of the gun? It
was in his hand when he toppled over the edge of the
platform, and must have fallen with him. So it could
not be far away, though perhaps buried out of sight.
He began patiently to inspect every square foot of the
ground around him, as far as he could trust his eyes to
see clearly, separating the space into imaginary segments
of a circle, and scrutinizing each of them until
he had set apart every tuft of grass from every other
tuft, and every stone from its neighbors. Minute after
minute, with dogged perseverance, he kept himself at
this exhausting task until the sweat was rolling down,
his face, and his eyes burned deep in his head. Then
suddenly something leaped inside of him,&ndash;&ndash;some nerve
that was quicker than thought in its response to vision.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gun lay against a stone, its muzzle upward, at a
distance of about forty feet, beyond and somewhat to
the left of Trixy. It would take some crawling; and
that would hurt. But when he had fixed the gun&rsquo;s
position in his mind, so that he might not miss it, he
set his teeth together, and started.</p>
<p>No great distance, after all, is forty feet. That is
to say, no great distance after you&rsquo;ve covered it. And
the pain did not matter now. He lay on the ground
again, flattened out, panting and gazing up at the blue
sky. The sweat stood in big cold drops on his face;
and he trembled as if stricken with ague. He could
not shoot in that condition; he must rest, and wait.
But the thirst was torture now.</p>
<p>After a time, he turned himself half around in order
to face Trixy, and rested his right elbow on the ground,
with the gun up in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Trixy!&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
<p>But wait! How many shots left? He examined
the revolver. Two! For an instant he was stricken
again with dread. Then his left hand felt for the belt
at his waist; and he laughed nervously. What a state
he was in! There were cartridges to burn!</p>
<p>The gun came slowly down to an aim, then waved in
his hand as he pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>He tried again, pulling himself together, and gritting
his teeth. The second report rang out, and echoed
high among the rocks. The mare&rsquo;s head fell, her body
quivered, one hind foot kicked out; and she was
gone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>Oh, yes! He could hit good horses! But not
Sunnysides.</p>
<p>He ejected the exploded cartridges, and filled the
chambers with fresh ones; then lay back and rested
again, the gun still clutched in his hand. And why did
he wait? To get strength, for one thing. He wanted
to sit up to do it, since he could not stand. And
then&ndash;&ndash;there was another trouble. Four times before he
had tried to do it, and something had happened,&ndash;&ndash;something
different and utterly unexpected each time had
checked him. It had not so much mattered then, because
he could afford to wait. But now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He drew upon the last of his reserves of strength,
and sat up&ndash;&ndash;too suddenly. An excruciating pain shot
through his injured leg, and radiated like flame through
every nerve and tissue of his body. The revolver, half
lifted, fell from his fingers. Swaying, he groped for
it, clutched it again, and frantically raised it to his
head. And when he felt the hard muzzle just above
his ear, he pulled the trigger. And so the third report
went ringing through the quiet valley, and Philip Haig
sank backward on the greensward, and lay still.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE MIRACLE</h3>
</div>
<p>Between two storms, the peace that lay upon the
seared and battered head of Thunder Mountain,
like the peace that comes to a sufferer between paroxysms
of pain, was of a kind unknown to lower levels.
In all the range of natural phenomena, in all the gamut
of sensation, there is nothing else at once so beautiful,
inspiring, and appalling as utter silence; and nothing
else so rare. To the sea, the desert, and the peak it is
given in few and perfect hours; but neither to the
desert nor to the sea is it given in such transcendency
as to the peak. And on no peak could silence ever have
seemed so like a miracle as on the flat top of Thunder
Mountain between two storms.</p>
<p>It were hazardous to say how far Marion was conscious
of the beautiful, inspiring, and appalling nature
of that silence. She was too deeply intent upon her
purpose to be conscious of much besides the material
difficulties in her path. She knew that on the gray-black
surface of the mountain nothing stirred; that the
winds were still; that no murmur of forest or ripple of
water or soft pulsation of a living world was there. It
was a dead place, dead these many ages; and all its associations
in her mind were those of death and the living
terror of death. But she was not afraid. True,
she was beset by fears, but they only hovered over her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
brushing her face with their black wings. True also,
her eyes roved wide, as if at any instant something unknown
and dreadful would come upon her out of that
blue sky, from behind the next rock barrier, or up from
the mountain&rsquo;s ugly heart itself. But these were superficial
fears, and in her heart she was not afraid.</p>
<p>From the moment that she emerged upon the first
terrace, where Haig had stood some hours before, she
knew that she would not go back until (and unless) she
found him. That had been her purpose from the beginning,
from the time she ran down the hill above
Huntington&rsquo;s, with Smythe following in alarm; but it
had been hidden from her until, in the exaltation that
ensued upon the finding of the ashes of Haig&rsquo;s fire, she
drove her pony up the last ascent, and knew that if the
mountain had claimed Philip it must claim her too.</p>
<p>But this thought was, in a sense, as superficial as
her fears; for in her soul there lived a perfect faith.
Through all her grief and jealousy and anger and despair
she had never entirely lost the pure light of her
star. She never doubted deeply that her love would
triumph, even when reason told her that it had already
failed; and the very words with which she had consented
to leave the Park by the last stage were hollow,
though they contained a prayer. She had prayed for
a miracle; and the miracle had happened. Why should
she be afraid?</p>
<p>So she was not surprised when the Twin Sisters welcomed
her without so much as a gentle puff of wind
upon her cheek; when the Devil&rsquo;s Chair, though she
held her breath at sight of what lay below, was scarce
more difficult than the ridge in Paradise Park; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
when the central waste, where the storm had leaped on
Haig, held no evil in store for her. The only obstacles
encountered were those presented by the trail itself;
and these, as Smythe had told her, though by no means
trivial, were not insurmountable to one with a clear
eye and steady nerves. It was never the trail itself
that was deadly; it was the wind that would blow her
into a chasm, the mist that would decoy her from the
path, and the storm that would beat her down among
the stones. But there was no wind, no mist, no storm;
and if that was not a miracle&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Several times, to be sure, she missed the trail: once
in the second field of loose stones, before she had become
accustomed to the signs; once on a wide floor of
solid rock, where Tuesday slipped and fell, and she
rose a little stunned, and in a brief confusion; and
once, the most alarming of all, when she was for half an
hour lost in that granite wilderness that to Haig had
suggested a cemetery of the gods. But faith sustained
her, and her purpose stood in the stead of courage that
might have faltered and even failed. The one moment
when something like despair struck at her heart was
that when she found the bruised and dirty saddle cast
aside by the runaway, and thought at first that it was
Philip&rsquo;s; and the one moment of real terror was that
in which, on the summit of the last ridge, she looked
back and saw that dark gray vapors were surging up
out of the chasm below the Devil&rsquo;s Chair.</p>
<p>It chanced that in following the trail from the sharp
turn on the last rock floor to the brink of the cliff (the
last pyramid stands some fifty yards back from it),
Marion arrived at about the same distance to the left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
of the drop-off as Haig had brought up at the right of
it. From this point even less of the meadow was visible
than Haig had seen at the first view, and the mass
of fallen and tumbled granite appeared even more formidable.
Her immediate sensation was of tragic despair,
as the evidence of her eyes for one instant overwhelmed
her faith. But where was Philip? And
Sunnysides?</p>
<p>Then a suspicion flashed into her mind. Perhaps
she had missed the trail,&ndash;&ndash;the real trail. She could
not have been mistaken in the signs; there was the last
pyramid in plain view still from where she stood. But
it was not unlikely that there was another trail from
the sharp turn where she had been confused for a moment,
another exit made necessary by the disruption
of the cliff. She paused uncertainly, looking now at
the great heap of stone below her,&ndash;&ndash;a thousand feet
of jagged rock and sliding sand,&ndash;&ndash;and now back at the
toilsome way she had come. And then her eyes were
caught by something that held her spellbound with
horror. Up to the rocky skyline from beyond the
barrier she had lately crossed there swept a tumbling
mist, as gray-black as the rock itself; and an instant
after she felt a stinging blow of wind on her cheek, and
heard a low whisper in the air around her.</p>
<p>She was roused by a sound that brought her up rigid
and alert in the saddle. What was that? A faint report,
as of a gun&ndash;&ndash;from somewhere. She listened,
turning her head slowly and cautiously, and holding her
breath. A long time, it seemed to her, she listened;
and heard only that warning whisper of the wind across
the flat. But there! Another! It came up faintly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
from below, expiring at the very edge of the precipice.
She peered guardedly down into the chasm, and saw
nothing but the vast pile of d&eacute;bris, and a bit of green
meadow over against the edge of the black forest. But
it was a gun! She began now to examine the edge of
the cliff. To her left it fell sheer away hundreds of
feet to the lower masses of fallen stone; and there was
no trail on that side. Dismounting, she led her horse
slowly along the brink at her right; and so came at
length to the spot where the trail dropped to the first
incline. It seemed incredible; but then, even as the
word framed itself in her mind, her heart bounded
up into her throat. There&ndash;&ndash;there&ndash;&ndash;under her eyes
were hoofprints, the print of steel shoes in the sand;
and they went down, down, down. And, as if to remove
the last of doubt and hesitancy, there came wavering
up from below a third thin report, a little more
distinct than the others, and undeniable.</p>
<p>She lifted her face toward the sky, and pressed her
hands upon her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help us! God help us&ndash;&ndash;both!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>Then she remounted Tuesday, and forced him over
the edge of the cliff.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Haig lay on his back, his head against the stone by
which he had recovered the coveted revolver. A handkerchief
dyed red and blackened with powder stains
lay against one cheek. His right hand still clutched
the revolver.</p>
<p>He did not move, and she thought him dead. Then,
through the blackness that enveloped her, she dully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and slowly comprehended that his eyes were closed, not
staring up at her. She knelt swiftly, and pressed her
head to his breast; and then leaped to her feet with a
wild outcry.</p>
<p>Tuesday stood a few yards away, with tail outstretched
and nostrils distended, gazing affrightedly at
the body of Trixy lying in her wretched heap. Marion
ran to the saddle, and tore at the thongs that held her
bundle; jerked it loose, and bore it quickly to Haig&rsquo;s
side; and in a few seconds had placed the mouth of her
whisky flask between Haig&rsquo;s lips, and let a little of the
liquid trickle down his throat. But there was no response,
and she stood up again, looking for water.
The brook that had seemed so far away from Haig was
at no distance for her flying feet; and she was back on
the run with her sombrero filled. Dashing the water
into Philip&rsquo;s face, she was off again for more. With
this she bathed his face and neck and wrists; and then
set herself to slapping the palms of his hands with her
own.</p>
<p>Still there was no response. But when she pressed
her head to his breast once more she was assured that
she had not been mistaken; his heart was beating feebly&ndash;&ndash;but
beating. A second time she put the whisky
flask to his lips; and returned to the limp hands, rubbing
them, slapping them until her own burned and
ached.</p>
<p>Hours it seemed, and ages flowing away into eternity.
The sky was darkening, and from the top of
Thunder Mountain came a muffled roar that was echoed
back and forth across the valley. She looked up at the
towering cliff, and trembled. And then, with the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
fading reverberation, there came another sound that
brought her leaning down close to Philip&rsquo;s face. Was
it a sigh, or only&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip! Philip! Philip!&rdquo; she called, softly at first,
then in a cry that rang across the meadow.</p>
<p>At last a quiver went through the limp figure; the
eyes were opened, only to be quickly closed again, as
if the light had hurt them. She called to him again, in
pleading accents. The eyelids fluttered, and he looked
up into the face of the girl bending over him. It was
a puzzled, uncomprehending look. And thereupon his
lips moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Philip! What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Marion!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Thunder Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that!&rdquo; he said, with a note of impatience.
&ldquo;Sunnysides and&ndash;&ndash;all that. But&ndash;&ndash;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I followed, and found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A weak smile flickered on his lips. She saw that he
did not believe her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Marion. And
yonder&ndash;&ndash;is Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved his head a little, and stared at the pony
still standing fascinated and terrified by the stillness
of poor Trixy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;impossible!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an effort to look up at the cliff down, which
he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s quite true, Philip. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>But she saw that he was still groping in the dark.
He lifted his right hand, and touched his head, while
the expression of perplexity grew rather than lessened
on his face. She saw that there was not only a gash in
the left temple, but a furrow on the right side of his
head, a swollen red streak where the hair had been
burned away. And the black stains on the handkerchief,
and the revolver clutched in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip!&rdquo; she said softly, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; he reiterated, and closed his
eyes.</p>
<p>She studied him, and the place where he lay, and the
dead pony; the two wounds in his head, the bloody
handkerchief&ndash;&ndash;And it was only partly clear to her.
He had fallen, and been hurt; but Philip, as she knew
him, would have made nothing of that cut on his temple.
Why, then, had he abandoned the pursuit, and tried to
kill himself?</p>
<p>A groan escaped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Philip?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurting me!&rdquo; he answered, opening his
eyes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurting you?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;No! Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My leg&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sharp cry she moved away from him, and saw
that in her eagerness she had pressed against his right
leg. For just a moment she was so concerned with the
pain she had caused him that she did not realize the
full significance of his answer. Then it came to her
with a shock. She looked slowly around her: at the
black forest on three sides of the little meadow; at the
cliff on the other; at the terrible trail down which she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
had come, she scarce knew how; and at the storm clouds
on Thunder Mountain.</p>
<p>He saw the thought in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With a broken
leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met his eyes with a clear and steady gaze; and
smiled. And that look he could not read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Philip!&rdquo; she said at length, rising
quietly to her feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To work?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she replied, with brave lightness.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot to do. First, there&rsquo;s your leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; he answered sardonically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll mend it. And the cut on your head needs
to be dressed. And I&rsquo;m dreadfully hungry, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, and the smile fled from her face, and the
strength ran from her limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you. It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; said Haig.</p>
<p>But she had one resource of courage of which he was
unaware: her faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she answered stoutly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enough in my
bundle for one meal anyhow. After that&ndash;&ndash;who
knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me a drink of water, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stooped quickly for her hat, the only vessel she
had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in the roll on my saddle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Murray
put some things there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced around uncertainly; then understood.
The saddle was on Trixy still. But Trixy was dead,
and she did not like the idea of touching her. She
hesitated just the length of time required for an unpleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
smile to twist Haig&rsquo;s lips. She saw it, and
her face flamed with shame. A fine start she was making!
And it was only a dead horse! She walked resolutely
to the prostrate body, hurriedly untied the roll
of blankets, and returned running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; she cried, as she unrolled the
bundle. &ldquo;A cup! A pan! And bacon and bread!
And matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murray,&rdquo; said Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Mrs. Murray told me, but I&rsquo;d forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to the stream, and brought him a cupful of
water; and another; and while he drank the second,
she picked up his revolver, and carried it to a stone
fully as far away as it had been when he crawled for it.
He was on the point of calling her back, but thought
better of it; to have done that would only have confirmed
her suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, sir!&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Your leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to set it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it absurd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it, in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can. I&rsquo;ve seen my father do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t heal&ndash;&ndash;in the fix we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best,&rdquo; she rejoined bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said, with some sternness. &ldquo;If it
should knit, which I doubt, it will take six weeks or two
months before I can use it. Do you know what will
happen before two months&ndash;&ndash;before one month&ndash;&ndash;before
two weeks, even?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>She only looked at him questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow!&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>She could find no answer, unless it were an answer
that she dared not give him&ndash;&ndash;yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then!&rdquo; he said, with an air of finality.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t start to-night, of course. It&rsquo;s too late, and
there&rsquo;s a storm going up there besides. But to-morrow
morning&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He looked up at the cliff and frowned.
&ldquo;Perhaps Tuesday can make it. If he balks, you&rsquo;ve
got to do it on foot. The mountain let you pass once.
Maybe it will spare you again. Maybe! God knows!
But it&rsquo;s your only chance. I&rsquo;m done for, and can&rsquo;t
help you. It&rsquo;s sure death for you to stay here. It&rsquo;s
sure death to try the trail into the Black Lake country.
You have just one chance. You&rsquo;ve got to take it to-morrow
morning. And God help you for being such
a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard him through, and smiled; and he noted,
for his own information, that this smile of hers was getting
on his nerves. What did she mean by it? There
was something very superior about it, though very
gentle and indulgent; and a thing or two she had said
to him before flashed back into his mind. Was she
trying to mother him? The thought made him angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll not go!&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go!&rdquo; he retorted wrathfully.</p>
<p>She knelt quickly at his side, and took one of his
hands between both her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip!&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I know that&ndash;&ndash;perhaps&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
a foolish question to ask. You mustn&rsquo;t
call me silly. But&ndash;&ndash;do you believe in miracles?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Miracles be damned!&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her hand over his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Philip!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I prayed for a
miracle, and it has happened. Perhaps there&rsquo;ll be another;
who knows? We&rsquo;ll wait and see. If nothing
happens, why&ndash;&ndash;Do you think I&rsquo;m afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made no answer, and she needed none.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>HAIG&rsquo;S ARGUMENT</h3>
</div>
<p>When she had unsaddled Tuesday, and left him
grazing near the &ldquo;camp,&rdquo; Marion set out with
Murray&rsquo;s hatchet and knife to cut splints for Haig&rsquo;s
broken leg. Haig watched her run across the meadow,
leap the brook, and hurry on to a grove of quaking
aspens at the edge of the forest. Then he lay back to
consider the logic of the situation, with the following
result, which appeared to him unanswerable:</p>
<p>First. The girl yonder had already saved his life
once, and was doing her best, though against impossible
odds, to save it again. Her motive was one that
need not be dwelt upon in this fatal crisis. The fact
remained that for him she was facing certain death,
and he must do all in his power to save her. That was
the starting point from which all reckonings must be
made.</p>
<p>Second. His own case was hopeless. Long before
he should be able to move from where he lay, the valley
would be buried in snow to half the height of those
pines yonder. If she remained with him her case
would be hopeless too. Death would be inevitable for
both of them: death from starvation, from exposure,
from cold. They had neither food, nor proper clothing,
nor shelter of any kind. The hardiest mountaineer
would not dream, of attempting to pass eight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
or nine months of winter in a place like that, even with
his two arms and two legs free. He, with his broken
leg, and she, a woman, would not survive an eighth or
a ninth of that period.</p>
<p>Third. The chances of rescue. There would be no
search for him, he reflected with a grim smile. But
for Marion, undoubtedly. To-morrow morning, Marion
not having returned, Murray would start out to find
her. There was not one chance in a thousand that, at
this season, there would be such another day as the one
now ending, and ending in storm. But suppose that
Murray should make his way across the summit, and
find them. Murray could do nothing for a man with
a broken leg at the bottom of a gulch with a cliff on
one side and miles on miles of mountain forest on the
other sides. As for Marion, if she would not go at his,
Haig&rsquo;s, command, she would certainly pay little heed
to Murray. So Murray would accomplish nothing.
However, it would not come to that. Murray would
be driven back by the winds. He would ride down to
the Park and give the alarm. Search parties would
be formed, and they would assail the mountain. But
fifty men would be no stronger than one man on Thunder
Mountain. It was just possible that some of them
might force their way across the flat between storms.
But every day that possibility, such as it was, would
grow less. It would be madness for the girl to wait.
She had crossed the mountain once; she knew the way;
and if the winds should permit rescuers to come to her
they would permit her to go to them. It was her only
chance, however desperate; to remain where she was
meant certain death.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>Fourth. She would not, it was quite clear, stir from
his side as long as he was alive. Therefore he must do
quickly what he had tried to do before.</p>
<p>The idea was so familiar to him by now that it required
no contemplation. He raised his head, and
looked toward the stone where his revolver lay; and
then toward the aspen grove where Marion labored.
His gaze rested on her for some minutes. It was too
late for her to start to-night, even if there were no
storm on the mountain. And if he did it now she
would face a night of solitude and terror, perhaps would
not live through it. He would wait till morning; and
when she should have gone for wood, or water&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She came back presently with an armload of small
limbs she had hacked from the youngest trees. Her
left hand bled where she had awkwardly struck it with
the hatchet; and there were tears in her eyes, which
she tried to conceal from him. He was sorry for her&ndash;&ndash;and
angry. It was not his fault; he had done all he
could, even to brutality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Huntington, or his wife, what you
were going to do?&rdquo; was his first speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I sent Mr. Smythe&ndash;&ndash;he rode with me
as far as Norton&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;I sent him back with a message
that I was going to stop the night at Murray&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Murrays? What did you tell them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;d be back before night. But why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that Smythe is a fool, and Murray is
a blockhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did all they could to stop me,&rdquo; she answered
quietly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>She had begun to strip the bark and twigs from the
green limbs; and he watched her crude efforts for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I might manage that part of it,&rdquo; he said at
length. &ldquo;You must build a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started to obey him, but stopped short, and
looked at him in sudden fear and suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can trust me with the knife,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She handed the limbs and the knife to him; and he
saw that her hands trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find plenty of dead wood at the edge of the
forest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t venture far among the
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadows were deepening along the other side of
the meadow, and he watched her a little anxiously while
she made half a dozen trips for dry limbs and small
chunks of half-rotted logs. And now she felt a curious
thrill as she began to employ the knowledge she had
gained on her camping expedition. She had never
dreamed that it would be so useful to her! And she
found new courage in thinking, while she worked, how
all her life she had been undergoing preparation, training,
education for this hour. She wished that she
might run to Philip and tell him all this&ndash;&ndash;and of her
faith! But he would not understand her.</p>
<p>Soon a fine fire was crackling on the grass, against
one of the largest stones that had fallen from the cliff.
Then she brought a small package from her bundle,
and made a cup of hot chocolate for Haig and another
for herself. This, with a small slice of bread for each
of them, made their supper for that day; for such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
provisions as they possessed must be treasured scrupulously.</p>
<p>Haig had by this time finished trimming the aspen
sticks; and by the fading light of day and the red light
of the fire they set to work to mend the broken leg.
Between them they knew something of surgery: she by
recollecting all that she had seen in her father&rsquo;s office,
where she had more than once helped Doctor Gaylord
with his needles and bandages; he by recalling experiences
on battlefields, in lumber camps, and in various
rough places of the world. She brought his blankets,
and helped him to move until he lay flat on them, with
his head propped against a stone. Then the leg was
stripped, and the ordeal began.</p>
<p>It was not the pain so much as the uselessness of it
that exasperated Haig; and he was tempted to drive
her away from him, and have no more of it. But this,
he realized, would only have caused more arguments,
and tears, and protestations, and perhaps the revelation
of his purpose. So he endured it to satisfy and divert
her.</p>
<p>Luckily the fracture was a simple one; and with
strips of linen for which Marion sacrificed some of her
scanty supply of clothing, and the thin sticks of tough
aspen wood, the leg was bound straight and firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only knew!&rdquo; said Marion at last, leaning
back to contemplate her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo; he asked between his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between pain and rage he could not answer her; and
thinking that he was near to a collapse, she ran for
water and bathed his face, and gave him a little of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
precious whisky that remained in her flask. After that
he lay quiet, and she went to her preparations for the
night.</p>
<p>The vale now lay in deep blackness, impenetrable
walls of it beyond the red circle of firelight. The cliff
made a dim, dark line against the blue-black sky; the
forest on the other side a ragged tracery. The stars
were few, and far. A low breeze murmured among
the pines, and swept softly, but very cold, across the
meadow. Marion began to feel the chill; and having
wrapped Philip&rsquo;s blanket tight around him, and spread
over him the leather coat she had found in his bundle,
she heaped more wood on the fire, and sat down before
it, with her blankets around her, and her rifle at her
side, to watch and wait.</p>
<p>She was very tired, but she dared not lie down to
sleep. A long time she sat there, glancing now and
then at Haig, where he lay very still, and oftener out
into the blackness. But drowsiness gradually overcame
her, and her head sank forward on her uplifted knees.</p>
<p>She was awakened by a terrifying cry that rang
shivering across the valley. She started to her feet,
and listened. It must have been a dream, she thought.
No! There it was again&ndash;&ndash;a cry that started low, like
a child&rsquo;s peevish wail, and ended in a piercing scream.
She grabbed up her rifle, and stood peering into the
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; said the voice of Haig from the
edge of the firelight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a bobcat. He&rsquo;ll not
come near the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&ndash;&ndash;Philip!&rdquo; she answered. Then, with
a nervous laugh: &ldquo;It did frighten me, though!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>She stood a moment, still listening. But the cry
came no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you sleeping?&rdquo; she asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With trembling limbs, and eyes fixed on the darkness
from whence had come the scream, she stepped
cautiously to the pile of wood, and threw more limbs
and bits of logs into the blaze. Then she seated herself
again, resolved that she would not fall asleep. But
presently she started to her feet in another panic at
sight of a dark form moving in the blackness. But it
was only Tuesday, coming nearer to the fire, as if he
too had been alarmed by the wild beast&rsquo;s cry. She
settled down once more to her vigil, her rifle across her
lap.</p>
<p>In spite of her resolution, her head sank to her knees
again, and she was aroused at length by the cold. It
bit through the blankets and clothing into the flesh of
her limbs; sharp shivers ran up and down her back; and
she was very miserable. Rising stiffly, she walked a
while before the fire until she stumbled from weariness;
then sat down again, and nodded, only to be waked by
the frost gnawing at her flesh. Again and again she
slept and woke in accentuated misery. But finally she
saw, with unspeakable relief, that the stars were paling
in their blue-black vault. She turned toward Thunder
Mountain, and watched the dim line of the cliff sharpening
against the whitening sky. Yet all was blackness
in the gulch, and it seemed a long time before a soft
gray light began to steal in upon the red light of the
fire, and a new crispness came into the air. She waited
until she could make out the forms of trees across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
valley, shrouded in thin morning mist, before she threw
the last few sticks of wood on the dying fire, and crept
to the side of Haig, where she lay down close beside
him, with her blankets wrapped around her. There
she fell into a heavy sleep, and did not waken until the
sun, rising above Thunder Mountain, shone warm in
her face.</p>
<p>For some seconds she lay luxuriating in the warmth
that seemed incredible after that night of cold and
terror. Then she moved softly, raised herself on one
elbow, and looked at Philip. He slept. His face was
haggard under his three days&rsquo; growth of beard. She
leaned over him, and pressed her lips ever so lightly to
his forehead. He did not stir.</p>
<p>Tuesday grazed a few yards away; the vale lay green
and peaceful in the sunlight; and from the pine woods,
where that hideous cry had lifted in the night, came
now only the gentle murmur of the breeze in the
massed foliage. By contrast with the chill horror of
the night, the scene was positively exhilarating; and
Marion rose to her work with hope throbbing through
every vein, and courage singing along every nerve of
her body.</p>
<p>First she fetched wood to renew the fire, now only a
heap of smouldering embers. That done, she went to
make her toilet in the brook, with the soap and towel
she had stowed in her bundle for the shooting trip.
Poor Seth! she thought, with a momentary pang; he
would not get the deer he wanted, after all. And by
this thought was set in motion a little current of regrets
that filled her mind until it was diverted by the stream.
She had intended only to wash her face and hands,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
now grimy after her labors at the fire. But chance led
her to a deep, still pool with a bottom of fine sand and
a tiny shore of pebbles that seemed to have been
designed for bathing. Temptation seized her, and on
the very impulse, seeing that a clump of willows
screened her from the camp, she eagerly undressed, and
plunged into the water, uttering quick gasps at the cold
contact, and short-clipped shrieks of pleasure.</p>
<p>And so, behold a marvel! Three days ago, in the
security and familiarity of the Park, where no hardships
or perils threatened, and where she knew that
Philip was safe in his cottage across the ridge, and that
her own pink bedroom awaited her at night, so deep
was she in dejection that nothing could have induced an
outburst of mere physical enjoyment such as this. But
now, while Philip lay on his blankets, a prisoner in
that narrow vale, and death stood at her side uncovered
and undisguised, her spirits rose as they had never
risen since her confession, on Mount Avalanche, and if
Haig had been listening he might have heard her low
laughter across the meadow.</p>
<p>Had she yet failed to realize her situation? Or was
it that tragedy had put on its comic mask, and
laughed at death? The truth is simple. Her faith had
triumphed over what seemed to be insuperable obstacles;
and she was with Philip, for better or for worse. A
miracle had been wrought; and miracles are not
meaningless, or idle, or without purpose. It was a
feeling perhaps unknown to man, who is merely a
reasoning creature, much given to material consideration
of natural causes and effects, and so compelled by
his limitations to grope in outer darkness. And it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
not so much a feeling as an instinct, and not so much an
instinct as a law, of which she was the involuntary
instrument. Her purpose was so strong within her
that there was no need of thought; and so she did not
think.</p>
<p>Leaping to the pebbly bank, she rubbed herself
swiftly with the towel, and felt the glow of health
rushing through her body, all pink and gleaming in the
sun. Then she dressed, and combed her hair; rinsed
and wrung out the towel, and hung it on the willow-limbs
to dry; and started back toward the camp in the
highest spirits, and eager for service. And then, at
twenty paces, she was stricken cold and rigid by the
sight that met her unsuspecting eyes.</p>
<p>Haig had left his blankets, and was now dragging
himself like a wounded animal along the earth. Already
he had covered more than half the distance to the
rock on which his revolver lay; and it seemed as if she
would stand rooted there in helpless horror until he
reached it. Then, with an incautious cry, she bounded
forward. Haig heard her, and flung himself toward
the stone with reckless determination. Where he had
inches, Marion had yards to go; it was a race that might,
in another age, have done credit to the ingenuity of a
Roman emperor. If Philip was mad with pain and
anger, Marion was frantic with fear and love. It
seemed to her that the turf gripped her feet, that the
wind in her face would strangle her, that her skirts were
leaden sheets around her knees. And she barely resisted
falling in a senseless heap when, at ten yards
from the goal, she saw that she would be too late.</p>
<p>He beat her to the rock by merely a few seconds; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
he was fairly spent. His fingers bled where he had dug
them into the sand; the sweat rolled down his face; and
exhaustion bound him as with bands of iron. Yet he
was able to reach for the gun, and clutch it; and with a
final effort that seemed to tear the heart from his breast,
he dragged the weapon under him, pressed the muzzle
upward, pulled the trigger, at the very instant that
Marion threw herself upon him.</p>
<p>There was a muffled report, the fumes stung their
eyes and nostrils, and for a moment both lay still.
Then Marion felt a movement under her, and guessed
that Haig was fumbling with the revolver. An indescribable
energy seized her, something tigerish in its
fury, and beyond her own proper powers, so that she
flung him over on his back as if he had been a child in
strength and size. With both hands she gripped the
wrist below the clutched revolver, and while she held it
away from his body she drew her own body over his,
and threw herself on his extended arm, between his
hand and his breast.</p>
<p>There was a savage struggle still, the man affirming
his right to die, and the woman denying it. But the
issue could not be long in doubt; for Haig&rsquo;s strength
was at the ebb, while Marion&rsquo;s flowed in from earth and
air and sky, from the future and from the past. And
she wore him down at last, until the revolver dropped
from his grasp, his eyelids closed, his limbs relaxed, and
he lay still. Waiting a moment for certainty, she
cautiously loosened one of her hands from his wrist,
and grabbed the revolver, and flung it with all her
might. Then, seeing it land twenty feet away on the
grass, she rolled away from him, and sat up panting,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
hollow-eyed, disheveled, and trembling on the verge of
a collapse.</p>
<p>For some seconds there was no sound but their
labored breathing; and not until Haig opened his eyes
and looked at her, with a hunted, baffled, and still
defiant expression in their somber depths, did Marion
break down. Then suddenly, after a premonitory
quivering of her chin, she buried her face in her hands,
and wept without more effort at restraint, in utter
abandonment to her agony. Haig watched, at first in
anger, and then in some confusion of emotions. Once
before he had looked upon her thus bowed and shaken;
and now as then he felt a strange upheaval, and an
unfathomable sensation that had no likeness to anything
he had ever before experienced. He wanted very much
to speak to her, but could not trust himself; and after
all, what was there to be said?</p>
<p>It was she who rescued him from irresolution. She
dropped her hands from her face, and cried out in a
voice that was broken with sobbing: &ldquo;Why, Philip,
why did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked, in something like amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;you haven&rsquo;t told me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to save you&ndash;&ndash;for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that your only chance is to go at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I told you I wouldn&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you know, Philip, that&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
see that&ndash;&ndash;if you killed yourself you&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;kill me
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There should have been no necessity for these words.
Perhaps any other man in the world, certainly most
men of far less intelligence and less acuteness of feeling,
would have known long ago just what she meant. He
knew, indeed, that this girl loved him; but he did not
believe that she or any other woman was capable of the
sacrifice implied in her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that&ndash;&ndash;you would have&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There ensued a silence that fell like a mist between
them, through which neither knew the way. She saw
that he had begun, by ever so little, to understand; and
she feared to say more lest a wrong word should overtake
a right one. As for Haig, his incredulity persisted
notwithstanding the unquestionable sincerity of
her speech. He did not doubt that she contemplated, in
this moment of emotion, the complete and final sacrifice.
But he was quite convinced that she would take a different
view of the situation when the test should come.
She did not yet appreciate, he argued, the peril of their
position; she had not realized the hazard of her adventure
or she never would have undertaken it; and
undoubtedly she still thought there would be a way out
for them. Under such a delusion it was easy for her,
he concluded, to talk about dying with him. But she
was tragically in error. His eyes lifted to the cliff.
She should have been up there on her return hours ago.
Now it was too late again; for the clouds were black
and ugly on the summit, and a distant roaring came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
his ears; and he knew what was happening or in
preparation in the middle of the flat. But he must find
a way to send her up that trail at dawn the next day;
and his gaze dropped to where the revolver lay just
visible in the thin grass into which she had thrown it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>DIANA</h3>
</div>
<p>Still no speech came to either of them. After a
while Marion rose silently, and went about her
work. First, however, she sought the revolver in the
grass, and carried it, with her rifle, to the clump of
willows by the brook, where both weapons were safely
beyond the present limits of Philip&rsquo;s powers. Then
she returned to him with her towel, one end of it wetted
and soaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I, please?&rdquo; she asked, smiling down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>She knelt, and began to wash the grime from his face,
to cleanse the wound on his head, and readjust the
bandage. Then his hands, after another trip to the
stream to rub out the soiled end of the towel; and she
was still busy with one of them, when she started back
with a cry. His coat had opened wider, and she saw
that his shirt was stained with blood. She had forgotten
the revolver-shot!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Haig. &ldquo;Only a flesh wound,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me!&rdquo; she cried, almost
with anger in her alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it, quick!&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>He looked at her a moment, then opened the front of
his flannel shirt and of the undershirt, and disclosed a
flesh wound where the bullet had cut a streak across his
chest. Marion bent close, and touched it with her
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she sighed at last, in deep relief.</p>
<p>Haig&rsquo;s reply was a laugh of which the irony did not
escape her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip!&rdquo; she cried reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it rather droll&ndash;&ndash;and ludicrous, when
you come to think of it? First, Sunnysides&rsquo; punch in
my stomach. And now, with my head cut open by a
stone, and a broken leg, and two bullet-wounds&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve
still got a splendid appetite. I ought to be on exhibition
somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sardonic humor hurt her worse than his anger;
and she went quickly to the brook to cleanse the towel
again. Returning presently, she washed the new
wound, and bandaged it; then examined the splints on
the broken leg to assure herself that, as nearly as she
could determine, no serious damage had been done to it
by his reckless crawl; and finally brought his blankets,
and insisted on making a sort of bed for him. After
that she cooked two slices of bacon, and on this, with a
little bread, they made their first meal of the day.
And this brought her to the next and most pressing
problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you help me think, Philip?&rdquo; she asked,
when they had eaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the larder?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>She smiled at his tone, in spite of her own seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacon&ndash;&ndash;perhaps enough for three days, with the
bread, if we don&rsquo;t eat much; and chocolate for four or
five breakfasts. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there deer in those forests, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. This is an un-hunted country, I
imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do? Whistle for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could afford to smile at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see my rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now&ndash;&ndash;yes. What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana of Thunder Mountain, eh? Well, I&rsquo;m
ready to admit you&rsquo;re some huntress. But deer!
That&rsquo;s another thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color flooded her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousin Seth taught me to shoot,&rdquo; she answered,
turning her face away. &ldquo;I killed a deer on Mount
Avalanche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did Cousin Seth learn to shoot? The
last time he&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Philip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when you&rsquo;ve brought down your deer, what
will you do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color deserted her face at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched him do it,&rdquo; she said, shuddering at the
recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo; she replied simply. And then, on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
a sudden thought: &ldquo;There should be grouse too,
shouldn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned to kill grouse with my rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with a wicked grin. This time he
had her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many cartridges have you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She ran for her belt, and counted the cartridges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So. If you never miss, you&rsquo;ll get twenty-seven
grouse. That would mean twenty-seven, meals. One
meal a day, twenty-seven days. I&rsquo;d still be on my
back, our ammunition would be gone, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried, in tears. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; he replied, almost gently. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;ll deny ourselves the grouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s got to be the deer. I&rsquo;ll begin now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s something else that must be done first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shelter, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly. But look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the dead body of Trixy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be easier&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps even nicer&ndash;&ndash;to
move me than poor Trixy. See that big pine yonder&ndash;&ndash;the
one that stands out from the forest? Well, you and
Tuesday must drag me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He explained his plan to her, and she set herself at
once to executing it. And her spirits rose again; for
she thought he had abandoned his desperate resolution.
So, indeed, he had&ndash;&ndash;for the moment. But he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
deliberately beguiled her; their situation he knew to be
quite unchanged in its inevitable termination, since a
food supply would save them from starvation only to
deliver them to the snow; and he must disarm her of
suspicion in order to find a way to send her back on the
trail. For he had reflected on the implication of tragic
finality in the speech that had surprised and disturbed
him; and he did not doubt that when the time should
come, and she should find herself alone, her high resolve
would prove to have been mere emotional exaggeration.</p>
<p>Mounted on Tuesday, Marion attacked the boughs
of a small pine with the hatchet until she had severed
three large branches, to which she tied Haig&rsquo;s rope, and
hauled them back to the camp. Of these branches Haig
contrived a crude drag, on which he crawled, and lay
flat; the free end of the rope was hitched to the horn of
Tuesday&rsquo;s saddle; and the journey was begun. Twice
the saddle slipped, and progress was interrupted while
Marion tightened the cinches. Once the drag itself
came to pieces, and Haig was left sprawling on the
ground. But eventually, with no more serious injury
to Haig than a bruised elbow, not counting his torn
clothing, they reached the goal.</p>
<p>There Marion made a wide bed against the exposed
top roots of the tree, filling the spaces among the pine
boughs with moss, and placing the two saddles at the
head for pillows. Night had come before she had completed
this labor, and gathered another supply of dead
limbs and rotted logs, and cooked their meager supper.
Then she wrapped Haig in his blankets, and rolled herself
in her own, and lay down at his side. What with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
watching and replenishing the fire, and listening to
night-cries heard or imagined, and waking from restless
slumber chilled to the bone, she slept as little as on the
preceding night, and was glad of the dawn, which came
peacefully enough on the heels of a storm that raged on
Thunder Mountain and sent a cold and beating rain
upon the valley.</p>
<p>This day brought its own bitter disappointment.
After her bath in the clear pool among the willows, and
their mere taste of bacon and bread in the name of
breakfast, and a promise exacted from Haig, as a condition
of her leaving him, that he would do nothing of
which she would disapprove, she set out to get her deer.
Rifle on shoulder, and eyes alert, she skirted the edge of
the wood along the base of the cliff, through tall grasses
of a golden green, among yellowing aspen groves, and
under a fair blue sky. But presently she plunged into
the thick of the forest, of which the trees towered to a
height exceeding that of any she had ever seen before.
In their tops the breeze was singing sonorously, but
among their massive boles the silence was so tense that
twigs cracking under her feet sounded like gun-shots
echoing through the dim aisles.</p>
<p>For some hours she wandered fruitlessly in that dark
labyrinth, not only mindful of Philip&rsquo;s warning that she
must not penetrate too deep into its depth, but fearful
on her own account of an encounter with some such wild
beast as that whose cry had terrified her. In time the
hollow indifference of the woods began to weigh upon
her spirits, which had been high and hopeful on her
setting out. Worn out at last, she was just on the point
of turning back toward the camp, defeated, when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
came upon an open space, a lovely little glade, in which
the grass grew rank and green, unripened by the sun.
She started to cross it, but stopped suddenly, staring
straight ahead. In the very middle of the lush and
silent glade, a young doe rose swiftly to its feet, and
looked at her. Marion stood and looked at the doe.
Then there was a streak of pale yellow across the grass,
the forest closed around it, and the doe was gone.
Thereupon, Marion remembered her rifle, and saw with
something like surprise, to begin with, that it was
pointed foolishly toward the ground. She gazed at it
a moment, then sat plump down on the mossy earth,
and cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a fool!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;What a poor,
silly little fool! I ought to starve, starve, starve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on the words the hunger that she had bravely
kept back rose and punished her. To be hungry in a
world of plenty, where she had only to reach out and
help herself! To think of Philip, hungry too, and depending
on her, on her boasted prowess! Humiliation
scorched her like a flame. And this was Marion Gaylord!</p>
<p>When she had recovered a little, she made directly for
the open strip, having no more heart for her task, and
nerving herself to confess the truth to Philip. Coming
out upon the knoll through thick underbrush, she was
startled by the leap of a rabbit from under her very
feet; and before she was aware of what she was doing,
she had thrown up her rifle, and fired. There was
really no aim; the action was a gesture merely; and if
she had tried to hit the rabbit she would have undoubtedly
missed it clean. But the unlucky little beast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
happening in the path of Marion&rsquo;s angry disgust, turned
a somersault in the air, and fell dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried Marion. &ldquo;Of course I can kill
rabbits.&rdquo; Then mercilessly: &ldquo;A rabbit a day for
twenty-seven days&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; And rage choked her.</p>
<p>But she picked up her rabbit, and walked on. In
half an hour she reached the camp, strode straight to the
pine tree under which Haig lay, and held up before him
the puny prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know you&rsquo;re proud of me!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
while her face crimsoned.</p>
<p>Haig smiled indulgently. It was a little better than
he had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be downcast!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;d get a deer the first day. You didn&rsquo;t even see one,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did, though! I had one right under my eyes,
not thirty feet away. And what do you think I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stood and looked at it, of course. That&rsquo;s buck
fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was only a tiny little doe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doe fever then, which is probably worse, if I know
anything about&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Philip! You&rsquo;re laughing at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. You&rsquo;ve brought home something to eat,
and that&rsquo;s more than I can do. Bunny looks big and
fat. He&rsquo;ll make a fine dinner, and leave something for
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Philip!&rdquo; she said gratefully. &ldquo;You
make me feel as if I were not such a failure after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll trust me with the knife,&rdquo; he said in a tone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
that took some of the edge off her satisfaction, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
clean him for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him the knife reluctantly, and did not
leave his side until he had finished cleaning and cutting
up the rabbit, when he handed the knife back to her with
a gesture that made her blush again. Two things she
did not know: that he had a knife in his pocket much
better suited to his secret purpose; and that his purpose
was a purpose no longer. But even he was not yet
aware of this last.</p>
<p>It was not the next day, but the third, when the rabbit
had been eaten to the bone, and the pangs of hunger
prodded her, that Marion restored herself in her own
eyes. In the edge of the forest, not more than two
miles from the camp, she detected a mere brown patch
in the browning bush. This time she did not forget
her rifle. The brown patch moved just as she pulled
the trigger; but when she reached the spot, in a fever
of anxiety, she fairly shrieked to the wilderness. For
there in the grass, still jerking spasmodically in its
death agony, lay a doe, a larger one than that she had
seen in the glade. No more &ldquo;one a day for twenty-seven
days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What followed haunted her dreams for many nights
thereafter&ndash;&ndash;a repulsive and sickening ordeal. She
had seen Huntington do it, but then she had been able
to turn her face away; and her hands&ndash;&ndash;But necessity,
responsibility, and pride, and perhaps some primitive
instinct also, nerved her to the task. And she staggered
back to camp, and stood before Philip, white and
trembling, but triumphant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a drink of whisky!&rdquo; ordered Haig sharply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>She obeyed him, gulping down the last of the precious
contents of her flask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s down there&ndash;&ndash;covered with leaves!&rdquo; she gasped
out at length. &ldquo;Will anything&ndash;&ndash;disturb it before I
can&ndash;&ndash;take Tuesday and the rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;ve cleaned the whole deer?&rdquo; he
asked curiously.</p>
<p>She nodded, still shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo; he said heartily. Then he
added: &ldquo;I thought perhaps a bobcat had stolen your&ndash;&ndash;rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed with him, and then was off with Tuesday
to bring her quarry home. She was not strong
enough to lift and fasten the carcass on the horse&rsquo;s back;
but the route was through clean grass along the cliff, and
Tuesday made short work of that, with the deer dragged
at the end of the rope.</p>
<p>They had no salt, but there were a few rinds of bacon
that Haig had told Marion to keep, and these were made
to serve for seasoning. That venison, moreover, needed
nothing to make it palatable; for they were ravenously
hungry. Sprawled before the fire like savages, they
feasted on a huge steak, broiled on two willow sticks,
and well-browned on the outside at the start so that the
tenderness was retained; and for an hour forgot. For
so the stomach, at once the tyrant and the slave, has
sometimes its hour of triumph, when heart and soul and
brain are its willing captives, and the starkest fears and
forebodings lose their sway, and death itself, though
visible and near, has no power to ferment the grateful
juices of the body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE SNOW</h3>
</div>
<p>In the night they were awakened by a terrific outburst
on the mountain top, surpassing all they had yet
heard since their arrival in the valley. The forest
roared under the onslaughts of the wind that swept
down through the gorge as through a funnel. Protected
though the camp was, in a measure, fierce gusts
now and then assailed it, and later the rain came, almost
in torrents, beating through the canopy of foliage, and
half-flooding the bed.</p>
<p>Marion, rising to renew the fire, felt that a sharp
change had come in the atmosphere. It was colder than
any night they had yet endured. Wrapped again in
her blankets, she was unable to keep warm. Her feet,
near the fire, were too hot, while her back and shoulders
ached as if they had been packed in ice. Turn which
way she would, on her back, on her side, or face downward,
there was no relief from that acid cold. She did
not complain, but cried softly, trying to hold back her
sobs so that he should not hear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cold,&rdquo; he said, hearing her nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little&ndash;&ndash;not very,&rdquo; she answered bravely.</p>
<p>But he knew very well how keenly she was suffering.
His injured leg pained him almost beyond endurance,
as if the frost had been concentrated there. There was
nothing he could say or do for her or for himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>Toward morning, the fury of the storm having abated,
they slept a little, fitfully and uneasily, in the half-insensibility
to suffering that complete exhaustion brings.
But they were glad when the first gray light of morning
stole in among the shadows and touched their eyelids.
With one accord, as if in a common apprehension, and
moved by a single fear, they raised their heads, and at
the first glance about them, sat up staring.</p>
<p>The meadow lay white under its first coverlet of snow,
the trees were draped in their winter mantles, their very
bed had its downy quilt of snowflakes that had sifted
through the branches of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; said Haig simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, in a voice that echoed a tragic
calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was due.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seth kept saying we&rsquo;d have a hard and early
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huntington&rsquo;s not such a fool as he looks,&rdquo; retorted
Haig drily, as he lay back to look up resignedly into
the foliage, where white now mingled with the green.</p>
<p>For some time there was no more speech. Marion
arose, and went silently about her work. She heaped
wood on the fire until the flames leaped high, and the
heat began to drive out the settled chill from her limbs,
and she could move again without dull pain. Then to
the brook; but her baths in the pool were ended. She
washed face and hands, and brought back the wet towel
for Philip. And breakfast was eaten almost in silence,
and without appetite; for the good venison that had so
rejoiced them the night before had already lost its
flavor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the circles on the trees yonder, where the
moss begins?&rdquo; asked Haig at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Marion answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the snow line. It will lie thirty feet deep
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had no answer to that. But she was thinking.
There must be a way. She had no idea what it would
be; but there must be some way out of it.</p>
<p>When the camp had been cleaned up, and the pan
and cup had been washed and put aside, and the fire
replenished, she brought her rifle from its place behind
the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for a walk,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Down along the cliff perhaps. I
may see another deer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You might as well. Deer meat will keep&ndash;&ndash;longer
than we&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He checked the unnecessary speech. She rewarded
him with a smile and left him.</p>
<p>And now he faced a curious situation within himself.
He saw clearly, but strangely without sensation, that it
was too late for Marion to attempt the passage of the
mountain. Whatever chance she might have had before&ndash;&ndash;and
that was perhaps even less than the one in
a thousand of which he had spoken&ndash;&ndash;she had now no
chance at all, supposing that he should force her to seek
it by measures of desperation. And why had he delayed?
He did not know. Had he weakened? Had
his injuries taken something from his courage? He
drew his treasured knife from his pocket, opened the
largest of the three keen blades, and passed it slowly but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
lightly across his wrist. No; his hand was steady; he
could do it without a tremor. He could have done it
yesterday, the day before, or any day. Well, then; had
he become sceptical of such a solution of his problem?
Perhaps. Six times in his life he had attempted that
solution, and always he had failed. And yet, what
could have thwarted him when Marion was far away in
the forest, and he lay quiet and undisturbed on his
blankets, in full possession of his faculties?</p>
<p>By such process of elimination he arrived at the final
question: was it she? Was it this girl that now stayed
his hand, in spite of all his logic and clear vision and
resolution? This girl, with her foolish faith, and misplaced
love, and futile talk of miracles? Was it written
that they should die together&ndash;&ndash;written in some volume
of the book of life into which he had never looked? Or
was she right? And would there be&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He looked out again upon the gleaming whiteness of
the meadow, at the snow line on the pines, at the remorseless
mountain. He passed slowly in review again
the chances of a rescue, the chances of their wintering
in that (soon-to-be) snowbound valley, the chances of
a&ndash;&ndash;miracle. And he shook his head. The odds were
beyond all reckoning; their fate was now as certain as
if the cliff yonder, rent by another cataclysm, had
tumbled down upon them while they slept. But he had
known this in the very hour of his awakening to find her
kneeling at his side; he had delayed giving her the one
chance of escape. And so, was it because she had commanded
him and he had unconsciously obeyed?</p>
<p>It was mystery; it was enigma. He tried to think
if he had erred in any way, if there was any fault to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
be attributed to him. No; he had dealt more than
fairly with this girl; he had spoken frankly and brutally;
he had never once consciously, by word or look, enticed
her. Unconsciously, perhaps; but how could he ever
have foreseen such consequences of the infatuation of
which he had become slowly and incredulously informed?
He would have gone raging out of the Park,
between two suns (and Thursby be damned!), if he had
ever dreamt of this tragic end of her midsummer
madness.</p>
<p>For two hours he lay thinking, torturing his brain
for an explanation of this mystery, an understanding
of this coil. And he was no nearer a solution than at
the beginning, when his thoughts were interrupted by
Marion. She came running out of the forest&ndash;&ndash;not
running, but fairly bounding, as if her feet were too
light to rest on earth. Her face was flushed, her eyes
danced with excitement. But then, seeing his grave
and questioning face, she stopped short in front of him,
suddenly embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would&ndash;&ndash;a cave do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice trembled between timidity and shortness
of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big cave&ndash;&ndash;really two caves joined together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the cliff&ndash;&ndash;down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed in the direction from which she had come
at full speed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How high above the level of the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him, and was again embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot that!&rdquo; she said, in deep chagrin. &ldquo;But
wait, please!&rdquo; She looked around her. &ldquo;I think&ndash;&ndash;I
know what you mean! It&rsquo;s higher up than the marks
on the trees there, surely it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little way from here. There&rsquo;s a narrow,
clear space all along between the forest and the cliff,
where the grass grows high. But there&rsquo;s one place&ndash;&ndash;I
missed it before, when I was just looking for deer&ndash;&ndash;where
the cliff&ndash;&ndash;How can I describe it? It sinks in,
and there&rsquo;s a slope up to it, solid rock. And at the top
of the slope I saw a black hole, and got off my pony to
look in. The slope is easy to climb. Tuesday climbed
it with me. The mouth of the cave is partly hidden
by a rock that sticks out so that you can see the opening
only from one side. The entrance is no bigger than the
door of your stable. I was afraid at first, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought of your miracle,&rdquo; he suggested, with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew something must be done, so I held my rifle
ready, thinking it might be a wild beasts&rsquo; den, and
listened a minute, and went in. There&rsquo;s the big cave
first, as large as the sitting-room and kitchen together
at Cousin Seth&rsquo;s, and there&rsquo;s a smaller one at the side,
with a narrow opening between them. The small one
has an opening outside too, just big enough for me to
squeeze through, and look out on the forest below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it cold in there? Did the wind blow
through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not. It seemed very dry and warm.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>He looked at her intently, and so strangely that she
blushed again, she knew not why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, anyhow?&rdquo; he asked, in a curious
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she faltered in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no faith in the experiment. Even with food
and shelter, there was still the cold that would steadily
sap their strength, and stretch them lifeless before half
the winter should have passed. But she should have
her way; it would divert her mind from the inevitable;
and they would, at least, be doing all their best. The
trip to the cave would be hell for him, in his condition,
but all that would be, at its worst, soon ended.</p>
<p>A whole day being needed for the removal, they ventured
to wait until the following morning. Storms
raged through all the night on Thunder Mountain, and
they woke again in utter wretchedness to find another
and heavier sheet of snow upon the meadow.</p>
<p>But Marion was soon up and at work in eagerness
and hope. The fire and the broiled venison renewed
them; and even the snow offered something by way of
compensation, for Haig&rsquo;s journey on the freshly constructed
drag was smoother over the snow than it had
been in the first instance over the stone-littered earth.
The ascent to the opening of the cave was, however, another
matter; and there was imminent danger of Tuesday&rsquo;s
sliding backward on the slippery rock, and crushing
Haig beneath him. Twice, indeed, such a fatal
accident was narrowly averted, and a less sure-footed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
animal than Tuesday would have resolved all Haig&rsquo;s
doubts in one swift catastrophe. But there was no
alternative, and Haig at length lay safe enough, though
racked and exhausted, at the mouth of the cave; and
when he had rested he raised himself on his elbows and
looked around him.</p>
<p>The top of the slope was almost level, and made a
kind of porch in front of their new abode, about thirty
feet in length and of half that measurement in its
greatest width. Haig calculated the height of the platform
above the valley&ndash;&ndash;fully forty feet. Below was
the strip of grass, and then the forest towering high
above them, protecting the cave, in some degree, from
the winds that would come roaring down the gulch. At
this height they should be able, in all probability, to
defy the snows. With a sufficient store of food and
fuel, and any kind of luck, there would have been&ndash;&ndash;God!
Was there a chance?</p>
<p>With his back to the wall! He had always been at
his best against long odds. None of the adventures of
the ten years that he counted as his life had ever been
for any kind of gain; and the finest of them had been
those in which there were the most tight places. So
this coming struggle with the elements, though it should
be a trial not of valor but of endurance and resourcefulness,
lacking swift action and a culmination in one
stirring hour, would once have allured him like a
splendid game. And even now, for one instant, while
he sat there keenly counting the forces on one side and
the other, the pride of battle lighted up his features,
and for that instant he was himself again. But a cruel
and timely twinge in his injured leg recalled him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
realities. His back was not to the wall; it was flat on
the ground. He could not walk, he could not stand;
and for weeks to come he would continue to be as helpless
as in that moment. To endure a siege of eight
months in the cave its garrison must have huge stores
of food and fuel; pine boughs and moss in lieu of bedding;
solid barricades at the entrances; and countless
makeshifts for the comforts that were denied. And
before he should be able to stir it would be too late.
No, it was an idle dream; a month would see the end
of both of them. So he lay back again, and looked up
vacantly into the cold, blue sky.</p>
<p>But Marion, standing at one side and watching him,
had seen that flicker of the fire within, and was grateful
for it beyond all reason or belief. It was all she
needed. Her hands were already raw and bleeding,
but she would work them to the bone if he would only
guide and advise and comfort her; and she knew now
that she could trust him, since there was no longer any
question whether she should go or stay.</p>
<p>All that day was spent in bringing up fresh boughs
and moss for their beds, and in making them against
the wall of the cavern where draughts would be the
least likely to sweep over them; in bestowing their
meager belongings; in hanging the venison from sticks
thrust into a crevice in the rock; in finding the best
place for the fire that must never be allowed to go
down, and in planning the storage of food and fuel.</p>
<p>Marion had no pressing anxiety about food, now that
she had brought in her first deer; but fuel was a different
matter. To her own appreciation of the problem
Haig, that evening after dinner, added some calculations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
that revealed it to her in its baldest aspects. The
morning, too, disclosed another layer of snow upon the
valley. The winter was coming on without pity, and
each succeeding day would see its lines drawn a little
closer round them. There was not an hour, not a moment
to be lost.</p>
<p>At dawn she began, with Tuesday and the rope, to
haul dead limbs and logs, the largest she was able to
handle, going far at first in order to leave the nearest
supplies for the last harvesting in deep snow. Under
Haig&rsquo;s instructions, she filled all the space in the caves
that would not be actually needed for their living quarters.
Then she built the logs into a square and solid
pile on the platform at one side of the entrance. These
were not logs in any formidable sense, being for the
most part half-rotted fragments of tree trunks that had
long been decaying in the mold. But they were dry
now, after the summer, and they made excellent slow-burning
fuel. The dead limbs she cut up into small
sticks, and filled the interstices of the heap, and all the
space between it and the wall of rock. And eventually
the whole platform was covered, and the slope on each
side, until there was no longer room for Tuesday to
mount to it, and barely room for Marion herself.</p>
<p>In the meantime, varying her exertions, she made
several trips into the woods for deer. After many disappointments,
she succeeded, before the snow became
too deep for further expeditions, in bringing back to
the cave a splendid buck and three young does. Haig
made for her a rabbit snare, and taught her how to set
it, and with this device she had the luck to add a dozen
rabbits to their store. And all this time she was piling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
up every stick of wood that she could find space for,
even making a great heap at the foot of the slope to be
drawn upon before the snow should cover it.</p>
<p>Always the snow fell, steadily, remorselessly. Every
night it snowed, and every day more or less, with intervals
of brilliant sunshine. The wind blew with increasing
violence, tossing the snow into huge drifts
upon the meadow, which Marion still saw sometimes in
her wood gathering, and sifting it in level masses among
the trees, and flinging it in great banks against the
cliff. Up and up crept the drifts and banks and levels
until there came a day when she could do no more.</p>
<p>And that day it seemed that she could have done no
more in any kind of weather, under any inspiration or
necessity. The record of what she did is but a footnote
to the page of what she suffered. Time after time she
had sunk down in the snow and lain there exhausted
until strength came to her again from somewhere, and
then had risen <i>manfully</i> to her work. For it was a
man&rsquo;s work she did, with a courage as much greater
than a man&rsquo;s as her strength was less. She was strong,
for a woman; she had lived all her life much out of
doors; and she had entered upon this ordeal in perfect
health. But her willingness outsped her powers; and
when the snow had spared her by driving her into the
cave, she fairly staggered and groped and leaned against
the wall, and knew that if she should now collapse she
would never rise again. But even in that climax of
her suffering, when for a moment she dared not move,
in fear of toppling over on the floor, and could not keep
back her sobs, there was an answer ready when Haig
called to her across the cave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Marion?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuesday!&rdquo; she answered chokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Tuesday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never balked or&ndash;&ndash;hesitated. He never threw
me&ndash;&ndash;but once, and that wasn&rsquo;t his fault. It was&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped. And out of what black depths, and
across what vistas of hope and despair and love and
anguish, she looked back to that scene in the golden
summer, in the Forbidden Pasture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Haig.</p>
<p>Then she told him brokenly how she had just said
farewell to Tuesday; how he stood at the foot of the
slope, thin as a specter, belly-deep in snow, his nose
lifted inquiringly toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Tuesday!&rdquo; she cried; and fled stumbling
up the slope, her hands on her ears to shut out his
plaintive whinny.</p>
<p>Haig watched her narrowly, and was not deceived.
Through the first few days of Marion&rsquo;s struggles he had
lain on his pallet in almost complete indifference, in
full acceptance of the fate that awaited them; not callous
to her sufferings, but resigned, as he thought, to
endure what could not be prevented. Having resolved
to humor her, he went from the extreme of resistance
to the extreme of submission, and hardened his heart to
endure what galled and humiliated and degraded him.
Then anger seized him once more,&ndash;&ndash;anger at Marion,
anger at himself, anger at Thursby, anger at circumstances,
chance and destiny: blinding and suffocating
anger. To have been brought to this shameful state, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
lie there watching a woman, a mere girl, perform these
menial tasks for him&ndash;&ndash;for him who had execrated and
despised and scorned her sex&ndash;&ndash;for him who had accepted
such services grudgingly even from men&ndash;&ndash;for
him who had stalked around the world in defiant independence,
indebted to no man and obligated to no
woman: this was odious and intolerable. And it must
be tolerated!</p>
<p>Marion knew nothing of this fiery ordeal through
which Haig came. Even in the fiercest and most maddening
moment of his agony, when honor and pride and
self-respect were being reduced to ashes, he did not fail
to realize that to cry out, to rave or curse or denunciate,
would only be to add something cowardly and contemptible
to the sum of his disgrace. He did not even cast
a stealthy glance toward his revolver, where it lay in a
niche in the cavern wall, though Marion was out in the
snow somewhere, and could not have stopped him if he
had crawled to seize it. That, too, would have been an
act of cowardice and of infamy; and something deep
within him now continually spoke for her, and for
whatever it was she stood for in this chaos that was the
end of all.</p>
<p>His fury slowly passed, and he had but emerged from
its strangely purifying fire into a calm that was well-nigh
as terrible, when she entered sobbing into the cave
to tell him the pitiable little lie that all her visible distress
was for a pony to whom she had said farewell.
He saw her presently totter forward to put more fuel
on the fire and begin to prepare their evening meal.
With eyes from which the smoke of passion had now
lifted, he saw what he had only vaguely seen before:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
that she was thin and haggard; that her pale face took
on a hectic flush in the glow of the blazing pine; that
her clothes were all in tatters, her riding-skirt slit in
many places, her coat and flannel waist so worn, and
torn that they barely covered her, and did indeed reveal
one white shoulder through a gaping rent; that
one dilapidated boot was quite out at toe; and that she
was ill and faint and silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; he called to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Philip!&rdquo; she answered, turning to look at
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came and stood before him, unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see your hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knelt, and held them out to him. Taking them
in his own hands, which were then far softer and whiter
than hers, he looked long at the raw and bleeding
cracks, at the swollen joints, at the bruised and calloused
fingers, at the nails (they were once so pink and
polished) worn down to the quick, and at one nail that
had been split back almost to its root.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not very pretty, are they?&rdquo; she said, with
a weak little laugh that ended in a quiver of her chin.</p>
<p>He lifted the hands, the right one and then the left,
and touched them with his lips. She was very weary
and faint and miserable; and he had never done anything
like that before; and so she drew back her hands,
and buried her face in them, and sank sobbing on the
floor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE IN THE HURRICANE</h3>
</div>
<p>Their sufferings, as the days went crawling into
weeks, attained a certain dead level of wretchedness.
At that level, should nothing worse befall, they
felt that they might exist through the eight months of
their imprisonment; beyond that level lay deliverance
by death. So they kept a painstaking account of time,
and made a sort of solemn ceremony of that hour when,
as night let down its black curtain before the entrance
of the cavern, Marion cut another notch in the wall,
and they clasped hands in a brave effort at good cheer,
and said to each other, &ldquo;One more! One more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold had steadily increased until it was just
barely endurable. By day it was possible to combat it
in some measure, but at night they were stung and
tortured by the frost that invaded the cave, and defied
their meager clothing. If they tried lying closely side
by side with their blankets spread over them, the cold
crept under the coverings, and bit through their garments
into their emaciated limbs. If they wrapped
themselves tightly in the blankets, one pair to each, and
lay near the fire, they were able to catch only a few
fitful moments of sleep before the frost on one side and
the heat on the other forced them to move.</p>
<p>At inexorable intervals the fire must be replenished.
Heavy with sleep that was not sleep, feeble from lack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
of nourishment, and stiff from cold, Marion would rise
and stumble to the nearest heap of wood, and carefully
lay two or three pieces on the dying embers. The fire
itself was to Marion a source of continual dread; for
not only did it consume their precious and unrenewable
supply of wood with a terrifying voracity, but she was
fairly obsessed by the fear that she might let it go out.
In that event they might never waken, clutched by the
cold in their sleep; or wakening, find that something
had happened to the matches. There remained a good
store of these in the box enfolded carefully in a bit of
cloth and a strip of deerskin, and bestowed in a high
niche of the cavern; but there was sometimes moisture
in the night winds, and there could be no absolute assurance
that the matches would ignite in an emergency.</p>
<p>The winds blew irregularly, sometimes roaring
through the cave, and filling it with a whirl of smoke
and snow, and sometimes creeping along the floor with
the malevolence and stealthiness of a serpent. Marion
had blocked up the entrance with small logs and limbs,
but the winds and draughts made scorn of this loose
barrier. Her clothes were fast falling from her body.
She essayed crude patchwork with strips of deerskin
and pins of wood, but these efforts were rendered futile
by wear and tear and the rotting of the cloth itself.
She began to be embarrassed when her flesh showed
through the rents in her garments; but Haig, with a
mingling of frankness and tact that might indeed have
been less easy in other circumstances, effectually helped
her to banish all false modesty from a situation in
which they were reduced to primitive habits and almost
to primitive familiarities.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>She was less able to accustom herself to the dirt,
from which there was no escape, but which irked her
nevertheless more than all else. She was no longer
able to keep clean in any sense of cleanliness associated
with civilization. Washing with water melted from
snow, without soap or towels, had only the effect, as it
seemed to her, to fix the grime more deeply in her skin.
And the hair that had been her pride had now no more
the golden lights in its tawny masses, and was becoming
dark and harsh and sheenless in spite of her most assiduous
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; said Haig one day, in a grim attempt
at humor. &ldquo;Just imagine you are a belle of
the Eskimos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip! How can you?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washing,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is only another error of
civilization. I have seen whole tribes of most respectable
aborigines that never bathed. And they seemed
to be quite happy. It saves a lot of time. But that&rsquo;s
another queer thing. The more time we need, the more
we waste it on matters that are really unimportant.
Like most of our attempts to improve on nature, it costs
more than it&rsquo;s worth, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Philip!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I can
forget I&rsquo;m hungry, but&ndash;&ndash;ugh! not this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she spoke too bravely about her hunger. Their
food by this time had begun to pall. The good venison,
of which they had eaten joyously at first, became tasteless
and then disgusting. They had no salt. The
bacon and the bread had long since been consumed, and
the chocolate also. There was left nothing but the
flesh of deer and rabbits. Marion stewed it, broiled it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
baked it under hot ashes; and they even nibbled at it
raw; but the time came when only the relentless pangs
of hunger, the hunger of the animal, the sheer clamor
of their stomachs could force them to eat the nauseating
food. In consequence of this revulsion, they were always
hungry; and sometimes, in spite of their resolution,
they descended to torturing each other with talk
of the good things there were in the world to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claire makes the most gorgeous apple dumplings!&rdquo;
said Marion on one of these occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apple dumplings? Ye-es,&rdquo; replied Haig judiciously.
&ldquo;But what about plain dumplings in chicken
gravy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fricassee!&rdquo; cried Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Maryland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, Philip, if I had my choice it wouldn&rsquo;t be
chicken at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Potatoes. Big, baked potatoes, split open, you
know, with butter and salt and paprika.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or sweet potatoes swimming in butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And salad&ndash;&ndash;lettuce and tomatoes and oil and
vinegar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then pie. Think of blackberry pie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And jam. I do love jam spread on toast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something,&rdquo; said Haig recklessly. &ldquo;I
could even eat sauerkraut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their worst craving was for salt. Marion could
fairly taste the spray of the Atlantic on the bathing
beaches. She dreamt of salt,&ndash;&ndash;barrels of salt and
oceans of salt and caves she had read of in which salt
hung in glittering stalactites. And Haig too. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
described a desert where salt had risen to the surface
and gleamed in crystals in the sand. And once he had
lived a long time on salt pork, which he had thought the
most insufferable food. But now! The taste of it
came back to him, and went tingling through every
nerve.</p>
<p>To free their minds from such tormenting memories,
Haig went deep into his adventures, his wanderings, his
search for excitements. He told her of strange lands
and peoples, of the beautiful spots of the world, of
battles and perils and escapes,&ndash;&ndash;everything he had been
through, with one exception. That&ndash;&ndash;the story of
Paris&ndash;&ndash;was still a closed book to her. And similarly,
there was one chapter of her life that she did not open
to him. A certain delicacy, rendered more vital by their
very situation, in which few delicacies could be maintained,
restrained them from the uttermost self-revelation.
The one subject that was not touched upon in the
most intimate of their conversations was that dearest to
Marion&rsquo;s heart and most incomprehensible to Haig&rsquo;s
reason. Partly this avoidance was intuitive, and
partly deliberate; where there was so much suffering
that could not be escaped, they were scrupulous to inflict
upon each other no unnecessary pain or embarrassment.
Between a more common man and a less
fastidious woman, placed in such propinquity, there
would almost inevitably have been concessions and compromises
but between these two there remained a barrier
that might have been passed by Marion&rsquo;s unquestioning
love, but never by Haig&rsquo;s inclinations, curbed
as they had been through many years, and still reined
in by his distrust.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>The day came when it seemed safe for Haig to stand
and to move a little about the cave. He had fashioned
slowly a pair of rude crutches, if they could be so
called,&ndash;&ndash;two pine limbs trimmed down with his pocketknife,
with their natural forks left to fit under his
arms. Marion protested that he was attempting this
feat much too soon, but she was compelled to watch him
in an agony of suspense lest he should fall on the hard
floor of the cave, or rest his weight on the injured leg,
and so undo all that had cost them so much of care and
labor. But caution restrained him; for he was aware
of the danger, though he was also half-mad with impatience
to be a man once more. Venturing only a few
tentative steps at first, he steadily accustomed himself
to movement with the aid of the awkward crutches, and
in a few days was able to take up some of the work
of their wretched habitation. Marion saw that this
pleased him immensely, almost as if he had been a boy
entrusted with a man&rsquo;s responsibility; and once, too,
she saw him stand a long time before the row of notches
on the wall, and thought his figure straightened, and a
flush came into his pale cheek.</p>
<p>And then, in the sixth week of their imprisonment,
Marion fell ill. She had caught a cold, which was
not the first by any means, but much more severe than
its predecessors. With watery eyes and red noses and
distressing coughs they had become familiar, but this
was plainly a more serious matter. For three days
more she dragged herself about, trying to conceal her
state from him and from herself, but crying softly
when he did not see her.</p>
<p>One morning, as the dawn crept into the cavern, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
tried as usual to rise from her hard bed, and fell back
with a stifled moan. Haig heard her, and raised his
head quickly, struck by an unaccustomed note in her
low cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Marion?&rdquo; he asked in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, dear!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he lay stricken, incapable of thought.
Not that the event was unexpected. He had been reckoning
on that; he had seen her steadily failing, and
knew that she could not go on indefinitely under such
privations. And yet, when it came, it was appalling.
The grayness of the cave settled down upon him like a
pall. Once he would have been indifferent to it, resigned
to the knowledge that it was inevitable. But
now he had come, if not to share her hope, at least to
sympathize with it, and to wish ardently for her sake
that her faith might be justified. And it seemed a
pitiable thing that she should have been deceived, an
intolerable thing that she should die there so uselessly,&ndash;&ndash;for
him.</p>
<p>He moved over to her, and placed his hand on her
forehead. It was burning hot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water, please!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>He hobbled to the entrance, and brought a cupful
of snow, and melted it over the fire. She drank the
water greedily, and begged for more. But he told her
gently that she must wait a little while. Then he sat
thinking. What should be done with fever? It would
probably be pneumonia, or something as fatal. And it
would take her as the north wind takes the drooping
petals of a rose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>He bent over her, and tried to soothe her with such
futile words as came. The look she gave him went
straight into deep, dark cells of his being that he
thought had been closed and sealed forever. She
begged him to eat; he must cook his own breakfast.
Oh, but he must eat, or he should not be able to help
her, she said. She would be quite well in a day or
two; she was sure of that; and he must not get sick too.
After he had been so patient and so good to her!</p>
<p>Haig turned away with a groan, and tried to obey
her. But eat? Eat that repulsive food that he had
choked down these many days only to please her, only
to subscribe to her foolish faith? He could not! But
presently she raised her head, and saw that he was
not eating, and chided him. Whereupon he swallowed
some morsels of the venison, and assured her that he had
eaten heartily.</p>
<p>All that day she lay there, her face flushed, her eyes
gleaming with a brightness that was more than the
brightness of her indomitable spirit. When she smiled
up at him he turned his face away that she might not
see what he knew was written on it. And then he
realized how much that smile had come to mean to him&ndash;&ndash;how
all unawares he had come to covet and to prize
it&ndash;&ndash;how he had half-consciously of late resorted to unexpected
words and gestures to coax it to her lips.</p>
<p>There was no sleep for either of them that night.
The next day Marion grew steadily worse, and toward
evening she became delirious. And there was no concealment
in this delirium as there had been in his.
All that he had not seen and heard and guessed before
was now wholly revealed to him. He was permitted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
see deep into the pure soul of the girl, into her very
heart that was brimming over with love for him. His
name came riding on every breath. It was Philip,
Philip, Philip! And bit by bit, and fragment by fragment,
he heard all the pitiful story of her love, of her
petty stratagems, of the wicked little plot she had made,
of the traps from which he had extricated himself, of
the pretended sprain in her ankle, of her watching and
waiting, of the anguish he had caused her, of her solitary
communion with the stars on Mount Avalanche, of
her dismissal of Hillyer, of her faith in the love that
should not be denied and unrequited, of her prayers for
a miracle that should bring him to her at last.</p>
<p>He looked down at the poor, small foot in its ragged
shoe; yes, that was the foot that was &ldquo;sprained.&rdquo; And
how it had trudged, and dragged itself along for him,
when every bone and muscle of her body ached! He
looked at her hands, thin even in their swollenness, raw
and bleeding, hard as a laborer&rsquo;s on the palms. How
they had toiled and bled for him! For him! And
what about him? What about Philip Haig?</p>
<p>He leaned back from her, and closed his eyes. And
suddenly it seemed as if something fell away from
them, as if something that had bound and imprisoned
and blinded him had been rudely shattered. In one
terrible, torturing revelation he saw clearly what he
had been, what he had done, what a miserable wreck he
had made of life, what a pitiable, dwarfed, misshapen
thing his soul had become in comparison with the soul
of this girl whom he had despised. He saw that he had
lived a life of almost untouched egoism, setting his
own wrongs above all the other wrongs in the world,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
counting his own griefs the greatest of all griefs, nursing
his own tragedy as if it had been the first tragedy
and the last. Bitterly, remorselessly he reviewed his
selfishness, his hatred, his senseless rage, the heartlessness
wrought by himself in a nature that had been, in
the beginning, as pure, if not as precious and fine and
beautiful, as hers.</p>
<p>And that was not all. He had taken woman for the
special object of his hatred. He had made himself believe
that all women were alike. Was there, then, only
one kind of woman in a world filled with many kinds
of men? Because he had been a fool, because he had
been deceived by one woman, he had concluded, in his
folly, that every woman was a vampire or a parasite,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;a
rag and a bone and a hank of hair&rdquo;!</p>
<p>And now there lay before him indeed (and the words
took on a new and more terrible meaning) &ldquo;a rag and
a bone and a hank of hair.&rdquo; Yes, this was all that was
left of her. This was what he had made of the most
joyous and most beautiful creature that had ever
crossed his path; this was the best he could do for one
who had had the misfortune to love him and the courage
to tell him so. This was his work! His memory
went back to that day before the post-office. How beautiful
she was then, how strangely beautiful, coming out
of that halo of light by the side of the golden outlaw.
Something had stirred within him then, as it had
stirred again and again: at Huntington&rsquo;s when she
reached for his revolver; in his cottage that last afternoon
of her nursing. And he had repulsed it, put it
down, and trampled on it, as if it had been an execrable
thing instead of the very treasure he had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
seeking all his life without knowing what he sought.
And now he recognized it for what it was&ndash;&ndash;too late!</p>
<p>He bent nearer to her, listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip! Philip!&rdquo; she was saying, in tender,
coaxing accents, with that quivering of her chin that
had many times been almost irresistible.</p>
<p>Then came the final break-up of everything within
him. He felt lifted as upon a flood, and a wild and
passionate longing surged through all his being. He
leaned swiftly over her, and clasped her in his arms,
and pressed her hot cheek against his own. And then&ndash;&ndash;it
was unendurable; he felt one of her arms softly
encircling his neck. There was just one gentle pressure,
and then the arm fell to her side, and her head
sank weakly away from him. He laid her back tenderly
on her hard bed.</p>
<p>He sat up again, looking at her and listening. She
rambled on in half-coherent speech. She had not heard
him cry out her name; or if she had heard him it had
been only a part of her fevered dreams. And this was
the crowning bitterness: that he should want to speak
to her, to tell her that he loved her, and she could
not hear; that he was too late, and she would never
know.</p>
<p>He leaped to his feet in a whirling tempest of rage.
He stumbled to the mouth of the cave, and thrust himself
half through the barricade, and looked out into the
wilderness of snow, and stood shaking his fist at it,
quivering with passion, and uttering the wildest imprecations
upon the world, upon the outlaw, and upon
himself. And gradually they centered upon himself
alone; and he stood presently, as it were, naked before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
God, with something like a prayer unspoken, a silent,
voiceless petition rising from his tortured soul.</p>
<p>He became calm after that. A curious peace, it
seemed, had flowed in upon him. Mechanically he renewed
the fire, brought water and held it to Marion&rsquo;s
lips, and eased her position on the bed. Then he sat
by her side to wait!</p>
<p>Well, this was the end. She would be going soon,&ndash;&ndash;to-morrow,
or the day after. He glanced toward the
shelf where Marion&rsquo;s rifle and his revolver lay. She
would not be there now to snatch the weapon from his
hand! But she would be waiting for him. And there
came back to him the strange feeling he had experienced
in his cottage&ndash;&ndash;the pressure of her hand still
warm on his own&ndash;&ndash;her hand helping up and up and
out of the Valley of the Shadow. And her hand would
be stretched out for him&ndash;&ndash;in the Beyond&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It must have been about the middle of the next forenoon&ndash;&ndash;he
had ceased to reckon time, and there were no
more notches cut on the black wall of the cave&ndash;&ndash;when
Philip, sitting at Marion&rsquo;s side, observed a curious,
restless movement of her head. She had lain all morning
in a stupor, very still, with only an occasional
murmur from her dry lips. But now, moving her
head from side to side, she tried to lift it, as if to
listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Marion?&rdquo; asked Haig, leaning close to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>He obeyed her, or pretended to, and turned an ear
toward the mouth of the cavern. The wind was up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
with its wailing and its snarls and shrieks. He heard
it for a moment, then looked at her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor girl! My poor Marion!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she repeated, with a touching emphasis,
almost childish, almost petulant.</p>
<p>He heard the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Marion,&rdquo; he said, humoring her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear it?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the delirium again; she was hearing things
that were not, except in her disordered mind. Perhaps&ndash;&ndash;he
had read somewhere that the dying, those of them
that are pure at heart, sometimes hear the calling of
the&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;coming!&rdquo; she cried in the thinnest,
most childlike treble. Her face shone; she tried to sit
up; she raised one hand feebly toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please lie down, dear!&rdquo; pleaded Haig, pressing
her gently back.</p>
<p>She resisted him, smiling and frowning at the same
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be&ndash;&ndash;very&ndash;&ndash;still. And&ndash;&ndash;listen!&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>To please her, he sat erect, and listened. They were
very still then, one of her hands between both of his.
And the storm was raging. It was wilder, wilder. All
the fury of Thunder Mountain seemed to be behind the
wind that came shrieking and bellowing down the gulch.</p>
<p>The seconds passed, with dead silence in the cave,
and that bedlam let loose outside.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Haig lifted his head. What was it?
There seemed to have come&ndash;&ndash;No, it was but a mocking
voice of the hurricane, one of the myriad voices of
that wintry inferno, mocking them with a half-human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
cry. He looked sadly down at Marion, and saw that
wondrous smile again upon her emaciated face. Oh,
but this was maddening! Yet because she wished it,
he listened again. And then, out of that tumult&ndash;&ndash;very
faint and far&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! My God!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>He leaped to his feet. He forgot his crutches. He
flung himself across the floor of the cave in three reckless
bounds, flung himself on the barrier of logs and
limbs, clawing it like a maniac, or a wild beast, tore his
way through it, and stood in the snow on the platform,
calling into the storm, shrieking, bellowing, out-shrieking
and out-bellowing the storm, swaying dizzily in the
wind, and clutching at the air before him in a frenzy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE MAN WHO DID NOT FORGET</h3>
</div>
<p>Out of the tempest came the answering halloo;
and Haig redoubled his outcries. Twice it
came, whipped and broken by the wind; and then there
was but the wind itself. Exhausted by his efforts, and
sick of desperation and despair, Haig sank back weakly
against the rock. Round and round him whirled the
snow; across his face the wind cut him with savage
lashes; in his ears there was nothing, nothing but the
storm. Then, all grew black before him. After all, it
had been an hallucination; he had been as mad as
Marion in her delirium; he had peopled the storm with
imaginary beings, had given the wind a voice it did
not know. Crushed by disappointment, acknowledging
the end, he was sinking down upon the snow-covered
platform, when, suddenly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hal-lo-o-o!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearer and louder than before. Haig straightened
up, and again filled the tumultuous air with
hoarse cries. Once more the voice came; and then out
of the white chaos at the right of the cave, almost level
with the platform, a dark form appeared, striding forward
with a peculiar swinging motion, clumsily but
sure.</p>
<p>Haig uttered one more call that dribbled into a sobbing
cry.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All&ndash;&ndash;right!&rdquo; answered the figure, in a smothered
tone.</p>
<p>Huge, hunchbacked and cumbersome, the figure
shuffled up the slight slope between the level of the snow
and the snowy platform, and halted. A mittened hand
went up to its head, and brushed the snow from the
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; cried Haig.</p>
<p>He attempted to move forward, stumbled, lunged
toward the Indian, and collapsed in his arms. Pete,
holding him, looked around until he saw the opening
of the cave, and fairly carried Haig inside. For a
few seconds, seeing nothing in the sudden change from
the dazzling whiteness of the snow to the dim red light
of the cavern, Pete stood still. Then Haig stiffened,
stood erect, and pushed the Indian from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! Look!&rdquo; he gasped, pointing to where
Marion lay, wild-eyed on the bed, wrapped in her
blankets. Then he sank down on the floor, with his
back against the wall, and gave himself up to dizziness
and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Pete quickly removed his thick mittens, unstrapped
the bundle that rested on his back, and took off the
snowshoes that had caused his approach over the snow
to appear so like a lumbering animal&rsquo;s. Flinging all
these on the floor, he went swiftly to Marion&rsquo;s side, and
knelt there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She did not answer, but stared at him, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Somebody&ndash;&ndash;coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pete stood up, and looked at Haig.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How long like this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget. Three or four days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Haig answered weakly.</p>
<p>Pete came closer, and pointed to the leg that Haig
kept thrust stiffly out before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian asked no more questions just then, but
hastened to open his pack. First he found a bottle of
whisky, and made Haig take a long drink. Pete believed
in two remedies for all human ills. He had a
brew of herbs that he had inherited from his tribal ancestors,
his sole inheritance besides his iron body. This
brew was good for fevers; and whisky was good
for everything else. Having doctored Haig with the
whisky, he now turned to Marion with the brew. From
a flask he poured some of the dark brown liquid into a
cup, let it come just to a boil among the embers of
the fire, and when it had cooled a little placed it to
Marion&rsquo;s lips. It was bitter, and she tried to draw
away from it, but Pete forced her gently to drain the
cup.</p>
<p>Whatever the brew might be worth, the whisky certainly
was efficacious. Haig sat erect, and began hurling
questions at the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get in here&ndash;&ndash;in God&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; was
the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Lake country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get in there?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Simpson&rsquo;s Pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig stared at him. He knew that to reach Simpson&rsquo;s
Pass the Indian must have gone far south below
the canyon of the Big Bear, made a wide detour over
the lower range, and ascended to the Pass around the
shoulder of Big Bear Mountain. He had never heard
of the Pass being crossed in winter, and it was almost
unbelievable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the snow!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Pete pointed to the snowshoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Pass doesn&rsquo;t let into the Black Lake
country,&rdquo; said Haig. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another range of
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I come over them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did it take you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been four weeks. But most of time looking in
forest down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you find us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian drew from his pocket a ragged and soiled
piece of paper, and spread it out on the floor. It was
a crude map, with Paradise Park outlined at one side,
and at the other a labyrinth of lines and stars and
crosses. The stars were peaks, the crosses were foothills,
and the lines were creeks and valleys. Through
the maze ran one heavier line that indicated the trail
through the Black Lake country up to the cliff at the
back of Thunder Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Parker made it,&rdquo; said Pete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all!&rdquo; commanded Haig. &ldquo;But wait!&rdquo;
He pointed to Marion.</p>
<p>Marion&rsquo;s babbling had slowly subsided, and ceased.
Pete rose and went to her noiselessly on his moccasined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
feet; and after looking at her a moment stepped
cautiously back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She quiet now. Sleep soon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And it was so. The next time he slipped over to her,
the girl&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and soon she had sunk into
a profound slumber from which she did not awake until
late the next morning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Pete took up his story. Smythe had
delivered Marion&rsquo;s message, and had told them what he
feared. Claire&rsquo;s knowledge of the state of Marion&rsquo;s
heart and mind enabled her to guess the worst, but Seth
scouted the idea of her trying to reach the top of
Thunder Mountain, or of Murray permitting her to
try it. So two days were lost before the alarm was
sounded by Murray, who, after two attempts to reach
the top of the mountain, had given up and ridden to the
Park for help.</p>
<p>The whole valley responded to the call, and the most
desperate efforts were made to reach the plateau, but the
storms that Haig and Marion had heard in their
sheltered gulch were of such fury and continuity that
the hardiest of the ranchmen were unable to prevail
against them. Huntington, half-crazed by the thought
of the two days he had allowed to be lost, had gone
farther than any of the others, and had been rescued
with difficulty by some of his neighbors, who found him
lying senseless at the foot of the ascent to the Devil&rsquo;s
Chair, where the wind had hurled him back down the
slope. Smythe was among those who saved him, for
the little tutor had let the last stage go without him,
and was one of the most reckless in the attacks on the
mountain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>All these efforts having failed, and the winter having
fallen with exceptional suddenness and severity, even.
Huntington was forced to accept the general opinion
that nothing more could be done; that they could only
wait for summer, when they could go to the mountain
top and bring back Marion&rsquo;s body&ndash;&ndash;and doubtless
Haig&rsquo;s too. And so, said Huntington, the feud was
ended.</p>
<p>One person alone in the Park refused to admit all
this. Pete was forced indeed to admit it in theory, but
he was resolved to prove it or disprove it on his own
account. He had studied Thunder Mountain from the
ridge above the ranch house all that day of Sunnysides&rsquo;
escape, and the next. And he remembered now that a
period of calm had followed the storm on that second
day. If Haig or Marion, or both of them, had by
chance reached the flat top in that interval, they might
have crossed, and might be now somewhere in the forests
on the other side.</p>
<p>He went to Parker, talked with him long about the
character of the Black Lake country, induced him to
draw the crude map, and then visited Seth and Claire.
Seth shook his head gloomily, but Claire eagerly proceeded
to assemble enough supplies to have loaded down
a pack horse. There followed a pitifully comical struggle
with her before her &ldquo;first aid&rdquo; was reduced to
what Pete could carry in his canvas knapsack,&ndash;&ndash;a small
roll of underwear, needles and thread, bandages and a
packet of household medicines in addition to Pete&rsquo;s own
selection of a strip of bacon, a dozen onions, two score of
vegetable soup tablets, two cans of condensed milk, small
quantities of coffee and tea, salt and pepper, two cakes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
soap and (especially insisted on by Pete) a plug of black
tobacco and a pipe.</p>
<p>All these supplies Pete had saved untouched, living
himself on game shot on the long journey. For nearly
five weeks he had struggled against unbelievable hardships,
fighting like primitive man against the fiercest
enmity of nature; had searched the whole Black Lake
country; and that day, slowly following the direction of
the trail up through the narrowing gulch among the tree
tops, the smell of smoke was brought to his nostrils on
the wind, and he traced it along the foot of the cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you really expect to find us alive?&rdquo; asked
Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you do all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I could do. Indian never forgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he brought out Haig&rsquo;s pipe and his own,
and they smoked over it in silence, late into the night.</p>
<p>Marion awoke the next morning with another look in
her eyes. Her fever was still high, but she was no
longer delirious. Too feeble to ask questions, she only
smiled, and took obediently the remainder of the potion
that Pete poured from his flask and heated in the tin-cup
among the embers. On her wakening again it was
seen that the fever was broken. But life in her was
only a tiny flame, at times the merest spark that every
gust of wind through the cavern threatened to extinguish.
Hour after hour Haig and the Indian watched
it, the one in such anguish as the repentant murderer
suffers as he kneels over the poor victim of his rage,
the other in stolid resignation, seeing that perhaps he
had come too late.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>But the spark was the bravest little spark in the
world; and it did not go out. In time Pete dared to
give Marion a little weakened milk; and then, when she
responded to the milk, a few sips of soup that was
scarcely thicker than water. And thus from day to day
they nursed her back to some recognizable shadow of
what she had been two months before.</p>
<p>There came an evening when they sat down to a
veritable feast. Haig had stubbornly refused to taste
any of the delicacies in Pete&rsquo;s store, excepting salt and
pepper. Besides, with seasoning, the venison was no
longer quite repugnant to his palate; and he and the
Indian did very well on that until the feast was spread.
And it was a feast remembered. There was soup, to
begin with, drunk from the two cups they now possessed;
then a rabbit stew, seasoned with <span class='smcap'>SALT AND
PEPPER</span>, and flavored with an <span class='smcaplc'>ONION</span>; and black coffee
(very black indeed, to be quite exact). Then Haig&rsquo;s
and Pete&rsquo;s pipes were lighted; and the Indian must tell
them again the story of the rescue; and let the wind
howl its savagest!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Claire!&rdquo; said Marion, with a tremulous little
laugh, when Pete told her how the knapsack was packed.</p>
<p>And Haig looked across at her dizzily, as if the fumes
of the strong tobacco had gone to his head.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Their situation was still miserable enough, but the
Indian contrived to make it less unendurable. He
knew some knacks of cookery that availed to make their
venison and rabbit palatable; and the tea and coffee
cheered them beyond all possibility of expression. No
longer required to toil; with clean underwear; with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
soap for her blackened face and hands, Marion recovered
her strength, or much of it, with amazing swiftness.
Pete made a rough coat and even a skirt for her
of deerskin. The coat was of double thickness, and
very warm indeed, and so she gave back to Haig the
remnant of the leather coat she had been wearing, which
was now needed to cover his ragged corduroy. Then
came moccasins, and better crutches for Haig; and so
they settled down with new courage for what they
thought would be a long wait through the implacable
winter.</p>
<p>Haig kept his secret, or supposed he was keeping it.
Marion did not indeed remember how he had taken her
in his arms in her delirium; rather, if there was a faint
but insistent recollection of the embrace it was intangible
and unreal. She had dreamed so often of that
longed-for embrace that the reality was inseparable from
the imagined. Nor was she aware of the revelation
that had come to Haig, as if a dazzling light had broken
through the walls of the cavern. But though he might
keep his secret he could not conceal from her the change
that had come over him, the tenderness and wonder and
humility that had succeeded his hardness and scepticism
and belligerency. She detected that alteration in every
look he gave her, in every movement he made in waiting
upon her, in every tone of his speech, though the words
were the most commonplace. And in her great faith
she was not surprised. But she was thrilled. The
knowledge ran through her veins like a living fire, a
better nourishment than food, a more potent cure than
any medicine.</p>
<p>So the long days, not quite so long as they used to be,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
marched on. Despite the skilful services of Pete they
were still always cold, always hungry, always weary for
want of sleep, and always dirty and unkempt. Then
there came a day when Pete astonished them. He
brought in from the forest certain small limbs of tough
wood, and began to trim them and bend them into shapes
that they were presently able to recognize. Snowshoes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&ndash;&ndash;Can we do it?&rdquo; cried Haig
incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; was Pete&rsquo;s short reply.</p>
<p>True; they could not stay there; it was just what
Haig had been thinking, or trying to avoid thinking.
But how would Marion be able to endure that terrible
journey over Simpson&rsquo;s Pass? For her part she said
nothing, but her eyes met Philip&rsquo;s; she reached her
hand to him, and he clasped it tightly.</p>
<p>Three weeks after Pete&rsquo;s arrival he began gradually
to inure Haig and Marion to living and moving in the
snow. He taught them to walk on snowshoes, to climb
steep slopes on them, to pick their way among the trees.
There were countless falls in deep drifts, and headlong
plunges, and ungraceful wallowings in the snow. But
they knew their lives depended on these labors, and they
were even able to laugh at some of their awkward performances.
These exercises were, moreover, very good
for them. Ill-nourished though they were, the natural
color crept back into their cheeks, the blood flowed
briskly again, through their chilled veins, their muscles
were strengthened by their struggles with the winds and
the snow that still came on with unremitted vigor.
Then Pete went a step farther in the preparations for
the crucial test. Not only must they spend the greater
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
part of the day outside the cave, but they must sleep, or
try to sleep, a few hours every night in the snow,
wrapped in their blankets, in holes scooped out under
the lee of a snowbank, while the Indian stood guard
nearby.</p>
<p>It was near the end of December when Pete thought
his charges had become sufficiently hardened to undertake
the long journey. The weather, if it had not
moderated (it would not begin to moderate there until
long after spring had brought out the flowers in the
distant Park), had settled a little after its first fury.
The storms came with less frequency, and the snow
had assumed a certain stability with the steadily added
weight. Both Marion and Haig bad mastered their
snowshoes, and were able to travel slowly after Pete.
Moreover, all the delicacies that Pete had brought had
been consumed, despite their most careful husbanding,
and even the meager supply of salt and pepper would
soon be exhausted, leaving only the unseasoned venison
of odious memory.</p>
<p>The night before the day set for their departure, Pete
broiled strips of venison sufficient for a week or more,
and stowed them in his knapsack. At dawn they were
up, and eagerly making the final preparations. Haig
and Marion, in their impatience, would have eaten
nothing, but the Indian, true to his tribal habit of filling
the stomach before a march, insisted that breakfast
should be a methodical and leisurely business. From
some recess he drew the last soup tablet, the last onion,
and the last of the ground coffee, which he had
clandestinely saved against this great event. The feast
with which they had celebrated Marion&rsquo;s recovery was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
now repeated in celebration of their farewell to the cave,&ndash;&ndash;the
soup, the rabbit stew and the black coffee.</p>
<p>Then, when Pete had fastened their snowshoes
securely on their moccasined feet, and had gone out to
trample down the fresh snow on the platform before the
cave, Haig and Marion stood together for a last look
upon the scene of their sufferings. They looked at the
dying fire, at the flattened beds of boughs, at the long
row of notches on the wall, at the crutches lying among
the firewood, at crumpled and ragged boots and bits of
worn-out clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by&ndash;&ndash;you!&rdquo; cried Marion, laughing tremulously,
very near to tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, good-by!&rdquo; said Haig.</p>
<p>That cave&ndash;&ndash;what had it not meant for him! There
was his Valley of the Shadow, into which he had again
descended to seek and find the better part of him that
he had left there long ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on out, please!&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously, but obeyed. Haig
waited till she had gone, and then shuffled clumsily on
his snowshoes across the floor to where, beyond the fire,
lay one of Marion&rsquo;s boots. It was a torn and misshapen
thing, the sole worn through, the leather curled up from
the open toe. He picked it up hastily, and with a
swift glance at the mouth of the cavern, thrust it into an
inside pocket of his leather coat.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was a wonderful, thrilling, terrifying journey,
filled with hardships and perils. Caution and sheer toil
of travel held them to slow progress. They went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
through vast forests, among the very tops of the tall
pines; they climbed wide, bare slopes where the winds
had almost stripped the snow from the gaunt rocks; they
descended into sheltered valleys where the deer went
scurrying at their approach; they crossed deep gulches
packed half-full of blown and drifted snow; they passed
close to the edges of precipices where a false step would
have sent them whirling down into white abysses spiked
with pines. Storms overtook them, and forced them to
remain many hours in such shelter as they could find.
Sometimes they slept under overhanging rocks with a
fire blazing at their feet, but more often the night was
spent in burrows dug in the snow. Their supply of
venison ran out, and a day was lost while Pete hunted
and killed a deer, and cooked strips of its flesh, to be
seasoned with the very last of their salt and pepper,
and kept in his knapsack. But even Marion did
not lose courage or once falter, though many times her
heart was in her mouth and a cold sweat on her forehead
as they passed some formidable and terrifying obstacle.</p>
<p>At length, on a bright and glittering day, when it
seemed the storms had finally abandoned their enmity,
they climbed slowly up the long slopes to Simpson&rsquo;s
Pass, and stood at noon high above a wide and wonderful
world of snow, with white mountains succeeding one
another, range on range, as far as their eyes could reach
before them and behind. And that afternoon, as they
toiled around the shoulder of Big Bear Mountain, they
stopped and gazed,&ndash;&ndash;Marion with tears streaming down
her cheeks, and Haig with his hands clenched tightly at
his sides. For there, still far away below them, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
<i>there</i> beyond all mistake, lay Paradise Park, very white
and still and glittering in the sun; and off at the right
was Thunder Mountain, squatting among the silver
peaks, its sullen head half hidden by gray-black
clouds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>GHOSTS</h3>
</div>
<p>The lamp had not been lighted in the sitting-room
at Huntington&rsquo;s, but the pitch log blazing in the
great fireplace reddened the farthest corners of the room,
and flushed the somber faces of Seth and Claire.
Their habit, in these days of grief, was to sit the winter
evenings through almost in silence, their self-reproaches
long since spent, their hopes turned to ashes, which
Claire alone tried sometimes to fan into a glow. They
had eaten their supper before twilight, without speech,
and then, as always, waited wearily for sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be three months and two weeks to-morrow,&rdquo;
she said, without looking away from the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it possible she may have reached&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Claire, thinking such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Pete! He hasn&rsquo;t come back, and maybe that
means&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not even finish the sentence, which simply
faded away on her lips, a useless and foolish conjecture.</p>
<p>Another long silence followed. Seth&rsquo;s cigarette went
out, and hung dead from his bearded lips, while he
stared gloomily into the blaze. He sat with his back
toward the front door. Claire, near a corner of the big
stone chimney, leaned forward, her head inclined to one
side, the cheek resting on her open hand, the elbow on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
her knee. Her eyes, which had been lifted from their
long gazing at the fire at the moment she addressed her
husband, were fixed on vacancy, looking past Huntington
toward the door that led out upon the veranda, where the
rising wind tossed little whirls of snow and dead leaves
from the flower garden. She was torturing herself
with a conjured vision of a wild, high place among snowbound
rocks, in the midst of which a slender figure was
slowly sinking down, and a white and stricken face was
turned toward her. This was the vision that had become
for her the settled picture of Marion&rsquo;s fate, a
picture that was burned into her brain by many, many
hours of imagining, day and night.</p>
<p>The wind was howling around the ranch house, wailing
among the gables, shrieking across the chimney top.
It rattled at the door, as if to fling it open with sudden
violence. And what was that? A footstep on the
veranda? She shivered; it was only her shaken nerves
again! Then came another rattle at the door. It
moved. It <i>was</i> flung open. And there was the figure
of her dream, but strangely and fantastically clad; and
with a face that glowed, and lips that were parted in a
smile.</p>
<p>For a moment Claire did not move. Then slowly she
lifted her head; her eyes grew round and staring, her
mouth opened. Seth caught the look; it was one he had
seen many times before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claire!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice, perhaps, served to break the spell. Claire
leaped to her feet. And the next instant there was a
voice from the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Marion cheerily, in a &ldquo;good evening&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
kind of tone, as if she had returned from the post-office.</p>
<p>Huntington bounded from his chair, and whirled
around with an oath,&ndash;&ndash;one oath surely that was forgiven
him. But past him, with a scream dashed Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; she shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; bellowed Seth.</p>
<p>And then the two women were in each other&rsquo;s arms,
and Seth grabbed one of Marion&rsquo;s hands, and the air
was filled with hysterical cries and mighty, spluttered
expletives. Then silence fell, while Claire and Marion
wept without restraint, and Huntington searched for his
handkerchief without finding it, and strode across the
room and back, pounding one clenched hand into the
palm of the other. But Marion presently tore herself
out of Claire&rsquo;s embrace, and turned to grab an arm of
Pete, who stood just outside the doorway, through which
the wind unheeded was flinging snow and leaves into
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; cried Marion. &ldquo;He did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claire promptly threw her arms around the Indian&rsquo;s
neck, or as nearly around as she could reach, and stood
on tiptoe to plant a kiss on his leathery cheek. Huntington
too leaped on him, seizing his shoulder and hand,
and dragging him farther into the room. Then he
broke away, and ran for a bottle; and the two men
clicked glasses and drank in silence. And two big
chairs were drawn close to the fire for Pete and Marion;
and while Claire sat crying softly, and Huntington, between
&ldquo;damns&rdquo; and &ldquo;hells,&rdquo; wiped his eyes with the
back of his hand, and Pete sat impressive, Marion
quickly narrated the chief incidents of her pursuit of
Haig, their long imprisonment, and the rescue.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But Haig! Where&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; asked Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left us at the junction,&rdquo; answered Marion.</p>
<p>On that a moment of silence fell. Something in
Marion&rsquo;s face told even Huntington to keep still. But
Claire, seeing it, was secretly, wickedly, triumphantly
glad. A very practical thought, however, came to her
in time to prevent embarrassment, and Seth was sent
bustling into the kitchen to relight the fire in the range.
The cook had gone to bed, but Claire would get supper
for them; for Pete must stay, she insisted. But at this
the Indian rose, and said he must go to Haig, who had
told him to hurry back for supper with him in the
cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Pete,&rdquo; said Huntington from the door
of the kitchen, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have another drink, anyhow.
And you&rsquo;ll come up to-morrow to tell us how you found
them, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pete promised; the whisky was solemnly drunk
again; and the three others followed him to the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must have a horse!&rdquo; said Huntington.</p>
<p>So he jumped past him, and ran to the stable, bellowing
for Williams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take off your coat, Marion!&rdquo; cried Claire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not here,&rdquo; said Marion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited before the blazing log for Huntington to
return, whereupon he was sent to build a fire in Marion&rsquo;s
room. When it was crackling finely, Marion, removed
her deerskin coat and skirt. Claire stared at her, gasping;
and then sank down on the bed in another fit of
weeping. For Marion stood before her in rags and
dirt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you should have seen me the day Pete
came!&rdquo; cried Marion, with a pathetic little laugh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve actually got some flesh on my bones now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indescribable luxuries followed: a hot bath, wonderful
clean garments, and Claire&rsquo;s happy fingers combing
the tangles out of the tawny hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll never be really and truly clean again,
Claire!&rdquo; cried Marion ruefully, holding out her hands.</p>
<p>Claire clasped them tenderly, while Marion, on
a sudden thought, related to her Haig&rsquo;s speech about
baths; and they laughed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve so many things to tell me,&rdquo; said Claire, with
a curiosity she could not quite repress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Marion, blushing.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight when they sat down to supper,
but none of them cared for time. Marion was not
sleepy. She and Haig and Pete had slept well in a
deserted cabin the last night of their journey, before a
huge fire, in circumstances positively pleasant in comparison
with what they had passed through. But she
was hungry. As she never expected to be really and
truly clean again, she doubted that she should ever get
enough to eat. Claire did the best she could on that
score, and that was something. There was chicken
with cream gravy; and potatoes, baked in their skins,
and seasoned with butter and salt and paprika; and
three kinds of jelly to be spread on buttered toast; and
angel cake. In the midst of the feast there were steps
on the veranda, and a knock on the door; and Curly
appeared, bearing two bottles of champagne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Haig says you&rsquo;re all to drink Pete&rsquo;s health, an&rsquo;
he ought to live to be a hundred,&rdquo; said Curly, grinning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
and gazing in wonderment at Marion, whose exploit
had caused her to assume somewhat the nature of a
goddess in his simple mind.</p>
<p>When the door had closed on Curly, Huntington stood
for a moment awkwardly holding the bottles, an expression
almost of consternation on his face. He had
once made some remarks about Haig&rsquo;s champagne.
But he had the sense not to act the part of a skeleton
at the feast. Pete&rsquo;s health was drunk by all; and might
he live to be a hundred!</p>
<p>In another hour Marion was in bed, in a real bed, in
her own pink room, between sweet, clean sheets, and
warm again at last, but shivering in sheer excess of comfort,
and crying a little perhaps from overwhelming joy.
For she knew in her heart&ndash;&ndash;something she could not
yet tell even Claire.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Bill Craven was mending a bridle by the light of a
smoky lantern in the stable, when he saw a ghost. It
just opened the door, and walked in, and said, &ldquo;How
are you, Bill?&rdquo; Craven fell backward off his stool, then
leaped to his feet with a yell that caused a commotion
among the barn swallows under the eaves, and brought
Farrish and Curly tumbling down the ladder from the
loft. Thereupon discipline, for which Haig had always
been rather a stickler, suffered a bad half hour. They
had given him up for lost; and had found on comparing
experiences that each of them had many reasons for
counting that loss his own. In the days following the
attempts to rescue Miss Gaylord, these three had gone
about the Park with chips on their shoulders, inviting
any outspoken citizen to say to them anything that was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
not strictly proper and complimentary about Haig. So
now, though the words were few after the first noisy
demonstration, they were the kind of words that are
worth hearing, from man to man.</p>
<p>Haig and Bill Craven presently compared notes in the
matter of &ldquo;busted&rdquo; legs. Bill&rsquo;s had mended much
sooner than Haig&rsquo;s, which was quite easily understood,
considering the great difference in their circumstances.
Curly had &ldquo;nigh killed&rdquo; the sorrels, getting the doctor
for Craven, but they were all right now. &ldquo;Fat and
sassy,&rdquo; Curly added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take some of that out of them, to-morrow,&rdquo; said
Haig. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want the sleigh, Farrish. Please look
after it in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, seeing their impatience, he told them of Sunnysides&rsquo;
final escape, and of all the events that followed&ndash;&ndash;as
much as was good for them to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Pete?&rdquo; asked Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to Huntington&rsquo;s with Miss Gaylord.
He&rsquo;ll be along soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, jest wait till we git our hands on that damned
Indian!&rdquo; cried Bill. &ldquo;Eh, men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that there would be a considerable disturbance
in the barn on Pete&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Haig had his surprise. On
entering the cottage he first encountered Slim Jim in
the outer room. Perhaps Jim&rsquo;s face turned a trifle
yellower, perhaps his thin legs trembled a little under
the sky-blue trousers; but that was about all, except the
light that flickered an instant in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you back!&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;Want supper?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Want supper! Why, you scrawny, evil-eyed
heathen! Want supper! I want everything you&rsquo;ve
got to eat, and everything you haven&rsquo;t got, and don&rsquo;t you
tell me there&rsquo;s &rsquo;vellee lil&rsquo; either, or I&rsquo;ll break every bone
in your body. And be quick about it too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim hurried into the kitchen with so much of a departure
from his oriental poise that the first pan he
picked up fell to the floor with a clatter. That was the
most eloquent testimonial he could have given, unless it
was the supper that was ready for Haig in an hour&ndash;&ndash;and
no &ldquo;velle lil&rdquo; supper at that&ndash;&ndash;to his participation
in the general rejoicing.</p>
<p>Haig, meanwhile, opened the inner door, stepped
into the library-bedroom, and halted dead still on the
threshold. At his entrance, a tall, thin young man,
with a very pale face, rose like an automaton and stared
at him. It was a question which of the two was the
more amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thursby!&rdquo; cried Haig, recovering the more
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the other side of the world. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the very bowels of the earth, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked slowly toward each other until they met,
and clasped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found him?&rdquo; asked Haig, searching the other&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Singapore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent her back to her people in Devonshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig gripped hard the hand that was still clasped in
his own, and there was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Haig, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have a nip of whisky, and
then&ndash;&ndash;You&rsquo;ve come back to take your ranch, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>came</i> back for that, but I can&rsquo;t figure out that it&rsquo;s
mine now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Haig, pouring out the drinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left three hundred head of cattle, and now I learn
there are thirteen hundred head, almost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that worry you. I&rsquo;ve sold enough of the
increase to bring back all the money they cost me. So
we&rsquo;re quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sensible, Haig. First thing, why did you do
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the fun of it, partly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your fine ranch here wasn&rsquo;t making much
money, and I thought you&rsquo;d need a good deal, perhaps,
before you got through with your&ndash;&ndash;affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you say we&rsquo;re quits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not. You&rsquo;ll take a half interest, and we&rsquo;ll
go partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say yes,&rdquo; persisted Thursby. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m forgetting
to ask questions. How the devil did you get
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will a tale unfold will harrow up thy bones&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
the rest of it,&rdquo; replied Haig, laughing. &ldquo;But first:
when did you arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the last stage in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you told them&ndash;&ndash;my pleasant neighbors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. But they have the impression that I
came for the final payment on the ranch, and that I remained
because you were lost in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now, old man, I&rsquo;ll tell you how you can
repay me in full for anything you may think I&rsquo;ve done
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to assume the responsibility for my
acts? I mean in the matter of the land and cattle?
The rest is still my affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then. I&rsquo;ve very special reasons for needing
peace with Huntington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thursby looked at him curiously. This from Philip
Haig!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want me to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I&rsquo;ve gone up there before,
and I&rsquo;m going again to-morrow. But I want to
give Huntington a chance. So if you&rsquo;ll go to his house
to-morrow morning, and tell him that I&rsquo;ve finished,
that the ranch is not mine, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the ranch is yours&ndash;&ndash;or half yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that now. We&rsquo;ll talk it over
later. Just tell Huntington that the ranch is not mine,
and never has been, and&ndash;&ndash;whatever else you like.
Then say to him that if he still wants to fight me I&rsquo;ll
meet him anywhere, and we&rsquo;ll settle it. In any event,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
you will tell him, I&rsquo;m coming to his place to-morrow
afternoon, and I&rsquo;ll have no gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he made a thorough job of it. He told them&ndash;&ndash;Huntington,
Claire and Marion&ndash;&ndash;that he had been in
great trouble. What that trouble was concerned nobody
but himself, but it was enough to send him around the
world, reckless of everything but the immediate object
of his pursuit. Philip Haig, an old friend, had volunteered
to look after his ranch for him, and to provide
him with money when he needed it. So, if Haig had
seemed too aggressive and selfish in his methods, all that
he had done had been done in a spirit of&ndash;&ndash;he might say
a spirit that was almost quixotic. And having done all
this, increasing Thursby&rsquo;s holdings of cattle four times,
Haig refused to accept anything for his time and labor,
and insisted that their account was closed.</p>
<p>Marion had known nothing of all this, save for the
hints she had received from Smythe, following the
conversation overheard by him. Philip had told her
nothing of it in recounting his adventures. With
glistening eyes she looked from Claire to Huntington,
where they sat open-mouthed, and was thrilled with
pride and triumph. Claire at length turned, and
looked at her, and smiled. As for Huntington, he was
simply (as he explained afterwards, seeking to justify
his ready acquiescence) flabbergasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a very bitter business, Thursby,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cost me a lot of cattle and money, and I&rsquo;ll
not take back a thing I&rsquo;ve said about Haig&rsquo;s grabbing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
everything in sight, and ruining his neighbors. But I
will say, after what you&rsquo;ve told me, that&ndash;&ndash;damn it,
Thursby! he is a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ready to fight with you or talk with you, as
you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntingdon eyed him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Haig say that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell him, if he&rsquo;s on the square, it&rsquo;ll be talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claire, ignoring Thursby&rsquo;s presence, ran and snuggled
close to Seth, while he put his arm around her.
But it was at Marion, <i>to</i> Marion, that Seth looked, seeking
the approval that he had never before been able to
get from her. Their eyes met, and she nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; said Thursby. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to see
you this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Huntington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming this afternoon. And he wished me
to say explicitly that he will have no gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Huntington this seemed almost incredible. He
was heartily sick of the warfare, and glad of any way
out of it that would not be too humiliating to himself.
But Haig was coming to him; and this meant, surely,
that something had occurred to his enemy that would
make the event easy for himself, if not quite free from
embarrassment. He looked again at Marion; and at
last, seeing her radiant countenance, he understood that
this was her achievement, that it was for her Haig
would be coming unarmed to the house of his bitter foe
that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he said to Thursby, with an elation he
was only partly able to conceal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>Smythe was the next visitor, arriving in a state of
such contrition that Marion pitied him. His jaunty
air was gone. He was quite unable to respond to
Marion&rsquo;s gentle jesting, seeing that her cheeks were still
sunken and pale, that the body whose graces he had so
much admired was now palpably thin under her loose
clothing. He had blamed himself bitterly for the disaster
that had overtaken her, and his sufferings had been
real and lasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been half a man I&rsquo;d never have let you go on
alone that day,&rdquo; he said after she had greeted him
brightly, giving him both her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; retorted Marion. &ldquo;And what
would you have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I sent you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fool to do as I told you, Mr. Smythe?&rdquo; she demanded
archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You didn&rsquo;t know what you were doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did know what I was doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This come with such depth of feeling that he knew he
would no longer be able to bring her news of Philip
Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p>Presently she told him her story; but much was
omitted, especially the keenest of her sufferings, since
remorse still haunted Smythe&rsquo;s solemn eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you been doing?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to read and study, but it&rsquo;s been no
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve lost a year in your career!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. I can make it up, if you&rsquo;ve forgiven
me.&rdquo; She gave him her hand again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to forgive!&rdquo; she answered warmly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a good friend to me. I owe you&ndash;&ndash;more
than you know&ndash;&ndash;more than I can tell you&ndash;&ndash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that she rose hurriedly, and went to her room for&ndash;&ndash;a
handkerchief. It was quite ten minutes before she
returned to finish their talk, and to tell him that he must
come to see her often through the long months of winter
that remained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE LAMP RELIGHTED</h3>
</div>
<p>Marion, at the window, was the first to see him;
and what she saw caused her to clutch at her
throat to stifle a cry. He was not on horseback, though
the roads were quite passable, but in a sleigh; and
there was a jingle of sleigh bells on the frosty air. He
had come with the sorrels&ndash;&ndash;for her&ndash;&ndash;at last!</p>
<p>She opened the door for him, giving him her hand&ndash;&ndash;was
it possible?&ndash;&ndash;a little shyly. Huntington, at Haig&rsquo;s
entrance, rose from his chair before the fire; and Claire
too, clinging to the chimney, scarce able to believe that
there would not be such another scene as that of one
evening long ago.</p>
<p>Silence, a little awkward for all of them, followed
Marion&rsquo;s greeting, while the two men stood looking at
each other. Then Haig walked direct to Huntington,
frankly smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Huntington? And Mrs. Huntington?&rdquo;
he was saying quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well,&rdquo; replied Huntington, rather stiffly, meaning
to be very reserved in this business.</p>
<p>Claire inclined her head without speaking. Her blue
eyes were round, her lips parted, and something of the
old terror showed in her face, though she knew very
well why Haig was there.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thursby has told you?&rdquo; asked Haig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was Huntingdon&rsquo;s answer, still putting
everything up to his enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, Huntington, since you&rsquo;ll deal with
Thursby now, I thought we might as well ask each other
a few questions, and give straight answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Huntington gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. First, did you drive that bunch of
cattle off the cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But did you scatter those twenty head of
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Both mere accidents undoubtedly. Second,
did you advise setting an ambush for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That was&ndash;&ndash;no matter who. I talked them
out of it, and was sorry for it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did say you&rsquo;d drive me out of the Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;d have done it any way short of&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sending me out in a coffin! But we all lost our
tempers, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with good reason on our side,&rdquo; retorted Huntington
stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But I&rsquo;ll ask you to remember that everything
I did was open and aboveboard. If any of your
cattle strayed, if any of <i>your</i> fences were cut, I had
nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&ndash;&ndash;now, after what Thursby&rsquo;s told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. We make progress. But there are
two things more. Who cut the fence of my winter
pasture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Huntington was silent, his face reddening.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I did that,&rdquo; he replied at length, half defiantly, but
in great confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? There was nothing to be gained by
that. There were no cattle in the pasture or near it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington hesitated, shifting his weight uneasily
from his left foot to his right, and back again to the left.
Then he looked at Marion, saw the appeal in her eyes,
and plunged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to make you angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make me angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make you do something reckless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haig studied him, and saw that he was dealing with
a man who was in some respects, and for all his physical
strength, a boy&ndash;&ndash;a child. He felt his anger rising,
but put it down resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very foolish, Huntington!&rdquo; he said, with
some sharpness. &ldquo;It certainly made me furious, as
you saw later at the post-office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were wrong to call me a liar and a thief.
And that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve got to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to what?&rdquo; demanded Haig quickly.</p>
<p>Huntington did not answer at once. Claire&rsquo;s face,
already as pale as it could well be, became drawn and
ashen, while Marion, seeing the danger, unconsciously
took a step forward, as if to throw herself between the
two men. For some tense seconds Huntington and
Haig faced each other belligerently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to what, Huntington?&rdquo; repeated Haig.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington had not meant the &ldquo;got&rdquo; in the sense in
which it was taken by Haig. He had begun to say,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to admit that was pretty hard.&rdquo; But his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
unfortunate pause on the uncompleted sentence had
justified Haig in putting the worst possible construction
on the objectionable phrase. And now Huntington
could not finish it as he had intended, without seeming
to back down, or weaken. Nor could he afford to drop
the mischievous word for another. In his desperation
he took the boldest course, and made a more aggressive
speech by far than any he had rehearsed for the occasion,
and forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take that back!&rdquo; he blurted out.</p>
<p>It was Haig&rsquo;s turn now to ponder deeply. His first
impulse was to tell Huntington to go to the devil, and
thereupon to walk out of the house. But he had come
there to make peace; and he bethought himself in time
that to give way to anger would only be to allow Huntington
the first victory he had ever had over him. Besides&ndash;&ndash;he
turned toward Marion, and saw her face
distorted with apprehension. That decided the issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time, Huntington,&rdquo; he said, with a
smile. &ldquo;Your actions certainly justified everything I
said. What have you to say about your scheme to take
my horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington groped in vain for one of the crushing
retorts that he had valiantly prepared for this meeting.
Then he caught Marion&rsquo;s eye again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m no thief
and no liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grant you&rsquo;re honest enough, Huntington, when
you stop to think. As for Sunnysides, he&rsquo;s settled that
business for himself. And if you&rsquo;ll give me a straightforward
answer on one more point, I&rsquo;ll acquit you of
being a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You killed my bull, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did! But it was a question of yours or
mine. They were fighting, and mine was getting the
worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it never occurred to you to let the best one
win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I was angry. It was the day that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He
caught himself, and looked in fresh alarm at Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Haig prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter. I was angry. I&rsquo;ll pay you what the
bull was worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Settle that with Thursby. Is there anything
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except the cause of the whole trouble.
You took more than your share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might talk all day and all night about that, and
come to no understanding. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve
done. I&rsquo;ve suggested to Thursby that he and you and
the rest of them go into a pool. There&rsquo;s enough pasture
for all of you if&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; cried Huntington. &ldquo;What does
Thursby say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s willing. He doesn&rsquo;t like trouble as I&ndash;&ndash;did.
He&rsquo;ll even sell off some of his stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huntington was silent a moment, looking doubtfully
at Haig. Then the best of him rose to the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Thursby that&ndash;&ndash;I hadn&rsquo;t anything to take
back, but that&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re a man, for all of it And if
you&ndash;&ndash;Damn it! There&rsquo;s my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Haig heartily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Claire, breaking away from the mantel,
to which she clung through all the interview, trembling
between hope and fear. She stepped up to Haig, her
eyes shining through tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine too!&rdquo; she said, offering her hand to him.</p>
<p>But when it was all finished there was another awkward
interval of silence. For years of controversy and
enmity are not so quickly resolved into perfect peace.
It was Haig who brought back a certain ease to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind, Mrs. Huntington, if I asked Miss
Gaylord to go for a drive with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she took dinner with me? I&rsquo;ll bring her
back early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Marion thinks&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Marion, who had stood silent and anxious until
then, did not reply to Claire&rsquo;s glance of inquiry. She
heard the last words as if in a dream. But dreams
were coming true these days; miracle followed miracle.
With a stifled cry she ran past them, and into her room.
There she sank down on the edge of the bed, and
crossed her hands over her breast, and stared at vacancy,
her face burning, a mist before her eyes. Weakness
overcame her for a moment. Then she leaped to her
feet, dressed quickly for the drive, and went out befurred
and radiant to put her arms around Claire and
kiss her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be welcome, Haig, if you want to&ndash;&ndash;to come
in any time,&rdquo; Huntington was saying awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; replied Haig.</p>
<p>Then Philip and Marion were gone, and Seth and
Claire stood staring at the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so happy, Seth!&rdquo; cried Claire at last,
holding up her arms to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said Huntington, submitting to her
ecstatic endearments.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The Park glittered in its robe of white; the sun
shone with cold brilliancy out of a steel-blue sky; the
air was still and sparkling, stinging their cheeks into a
glow as they sped down the valley. Under the runners
of the sleigh the dry snow sang and crackled, and flew
up in a fine shower like dust of diamonds beneath the
swift feet of the sorrels.</p>
<p>Haig gave Marion no chance to say a word while the
sleigh went swinging and bounding down the road, and
the fields slipped past them in a dazzling succession.
When he was not leaning forward to urge the sorrels to
greater speed he was talking rapidly. He told her of
the scenes at the stable and the cottage on his return,
elaborating the description until Marion&rsquo;s laughter
rang above the sounds of their swift traveling. He was
talking to keep up his courage, and to postpone the
speech that was in his heart and that now, after all,
when the time had come, filled him with doubts and
fears, and seemed to him the boldest thing he had ever
set himself to do. For the first time in ten years he
was afraid, and doubtful of himself.</p>
<p>The door of the cottage was thrown open by Slim
Jim, in his newest and brightest costume of blue silk.
Marion smiled at him as she passed, for she could not
trust herself to speak; and then she was in that room
whence she had gone one day in utter dejection, praying
for a miracle. She stood for a few seconds looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
around her, recognizing all the familiar objects: the
bed where Haig had undergone his agonies, the table
where the medicines had stood, the window and a
glimpse of the slope outside, now white instead of yellowing
green. There was a roaring fire, and tea things
stood on the table.</p>
<p>Silence enveloped them while Philip helped her with
her wraps, and saw her seated in an armchair before
the fire. Despite the color that the cold drive had
brought into her cheeks, her features were still pinched
and pale. Many weeks would be required, a summer
perhaps, to restore her to what she had been before her
terrible experience. And yet she seemed to him more
beautiful than ever. Watching her furtively and anxiously,
he endured a raging conflict of emotions, recalling
with a poignant feeling of shame all that he had
said to her in that room and elsewhere, in return for
what she had done for him. An impulse seized him to
rush to the door and lock it, to turn on her savagely,
forbidding her to leave him as he had forbidden her to
come to him. For all the proofs he had had of her love
and devotion seemed inadequate to quiet the doubts
he now confessed. He found speech strangely difficult;
he went out of the room twice to give quite unnecessary
instructions to Jim; and returned to busy himself arranging
things in the room that obviously needed no
arranging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thursby was good enough to go somewhere to-day,
and let us have the cottage,&rdquo; he managed to say at
length. &ldquo;Do you mind if we are quite alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip!&rdquo; she responded reproachfully. &ldquo;How
you talk!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called the Chinaman, who brought in the steaming
teapot, the hot milk, and the buttered toast.
Marion poured the tea in silence. They drank, too,
almost in silence, and nibbled at the toast, forgetful
that two days before, and for three dreadful months,
tea and toast and milk, served on a table laid with
white linen, would have seemed like a heavenly dispensation.
Their very experience in the cave, which
had broken down so many barriers between them,
seemed to have reared a new one that neither understood.
It was Marion who made a beginning to scale
that barrier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made Claire very happy, Philip,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was easy,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you too&ndash;&ndash;a little?&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that, Philip!&rdquo; And then, a little mischievously:
&ldquo;Remember I tried to make peace between
you once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a fine job you made of it!&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>Then they both laughed, and lapsed again into silence.
But presently Haig arose, went to a cabinet standing
against the wall, and brought back a faded photograph,
which he handed to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She saw a face that seemed a little sad, but the kindest
of eyes, with a half serious twinkle in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear man!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were great friends,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We used to
take long walks together of a Sunday afternoon. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
was a silent man, rather, and we did not talk much, but&ndash;&ndash;shall
I tell you one thing he used to say to me,
often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believed it then. But things happened to make
me think that father was mistaken. For ten years I
didn&rsquo;t believe it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to say: &lsquo;My boy, there&rsquo;s only one thing
in the world that&rsquo;s worth while. And that is love.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s what Daddy always said, almost his
very words!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes filling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only knew&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>But she could endure no more. She rose swiftly to
her feet, her eyes devouring him, her arms stretched
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; he cried, and leaped to catch her, and
folded her close, as he had clasped her in the cave. But
now the arms that stole up around his neck did not
fall away weakly as before, but tightened, and held
him.</p>
<p>A long time they remained thus, in a silence broken
only by the crackling of the flames, which they did not
hear, and the wind rising outside the cottage, for which
they did not care. At length he put his fingers under
her chin, and raised her head so that he could look into
her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it now!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; she answered, so low that he scarcely
heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved you always!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></div>
<p>Then even in her joy the recollection of all that she
had come through to this moment brought back that
quivering of her chin, which had become only too
familiar to him in days past. His head sank toward
her, and their lips met.</p>
<p>After a while he led her back to her chair, and knelt
down to look up at her. For there were other difficulties.
He had nothing to give her, he said; neither
riches nor family nor honor nor any future of which
he could be assured. She stopped him, with a hand
laid gently on his lips. He held it there, kissing it.
How it had toiled and hurt for him, that little hand,
still rough and scarred!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you ever forgive me?&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to forgive, Philip. You did not
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! You&rsquo;re treating me like a child again!&rdquo;
he protested, smiling contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And once you scolded me dreadfully for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were right. I&rsquo;ve been a child; for
ten years I&rsquo;ve been a child that thought it was a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not reply to that, fearing to wound him.
So another golden silence fell between them, while he
held her hands, stroking the hard, cracked skin of them.
After a while he brought a chair, and sat close by her
side, and told her all that had been left untold,&ndash;&ndash;about
his boyhood, his ambitions, his ignorance and innocence,
his work in Paris and the future it seemed to
hold for him; and then the girl on the Seine boat, and
what he saw one night in her apartment, and his despair;
his father&rsquo;s death, and the wanderings that followed;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
and how the shy and introspective boy had become
in one day a man of violence and desperation, his
heart full of hatred and bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I thought, Marion, that you were all alike;
not alike in all things, but the virtuous more dangerous
than the vicious, because more calculating and cold.
You even&ndash;&ndash;I thought you were the most dangerous of
all. I knew you were good, but I said your goodness
was only another form of selfishness, that you had been
reared in luxury, and taught to expect as your right
many things you had never earned and never could earn
or deserve. I said&ndash;&ndash;Wait, dear&ndash;&ndash;I said that the
man who should marry you would be nothing but a
beast of burden, a slave. It was so difficult to believe
you could be content with&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With love!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>can</i> you?&rdquo; he demanded, a ghost of the old incredulity
rising in spite of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you about Robert,&rdquo; she said softly.
&ldquo;He has wealth, and will have much more. He loves
me. He offered me all, to do with it as I wished. I&rsquo;ve
known him all my life&ndash;&ndash;almost. He&rsquo;s good too, poor
Robert! But that day, after you&rsquo;d told me that I
must go back to New York at once, I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marion!&rdquo; Haig cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, listen! I told him that day that I could never
marry him. He couldn&rsquo;t understand&ndash;&ndash;like you,
Philip. He thought&ndash;&ndash;dear Robert!&ndash;&ndash;he thought
that money&ndash;&ndash;I know it&rsquo;s what they want most&ndash;&ndash;so
many women. But, Philip, dear heart! Don&rsquo;t you
know that if a woman really loves there&rsquo;s nothing she
won&rsquo;t do&ndash;&ndash;on her hands and knees&ndash;&ndash;to the end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
the world? And if she has love, what else is there&ndash;&ndash;that
matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I couldn&rsquo;t have
believed it until&ndash;&ndash;that day in the cave, when you fell
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her then of the revelation that had come to
him, and how he had taken her in his arms, in a fury
of love and despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought it was a dream!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I found you then&ndash;&ndash;and myself&ndash;&ndash;and
thought it was too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, across the table, when Slim Jim had brought
in the after-dinner coffee, Haig looked at her gravely,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I become very practical for a minute,
Marion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not too practical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this: I&rsquo;ve got&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to reach for her hand, to clasp it on the
cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>When</i>, Marion?&rdquo; he asked, leaning toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we must talk with Claire about that, mustn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; she protested, blushing. Then softly: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
the only mother I&rsquo;ve got, you see. And besides, there&rsquo;s
no&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not even a justice of the peace!&rdquo; he said,
laughing. &ldquo;We might strap on our old snowshoes, and
go to Tellurium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, listen. Do you know what I&rsquo;ve been thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris?&rdquo; she repeated, a little startled, after all
that he had revealed to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve got a little money in the bank in Tellurium,
and I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be so proud of it!&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;So have I, in New York. So you needn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
your money I&rsquo;m after, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed, and then he had both her hands across
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much, I assure you,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;But
it will do for a while in Paris. I mean&ndash;&ndash;if you will
go with me&ndash;&ndash;to find my old master, or another. You
know, Marion, he said to me many times: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
going to be a painter some day, <i>mon petit</i>; you&rsquo;re going
to do big things, if you&rsquo;ll work, work, work.&rsquo; And
so&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll paint again!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, and I shall
keep house for you! You may not believe it, but I&rsquo;m a
splendid cook. But I&rsquo;ve got to have salt. You must
earn enough to buy salt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he rose, and went again to the cabinet from
which he had brought the photograph, and returned
with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose I&rsquo;ve got for our mantelpiece&ndash;&ndash;if
we have such a thing in our attic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world, Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your eyes, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed, and in the middle of the table he set
down the tattered and grimy little boot that he had carried
away from the cave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now open!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, staring at the eloquent memento.</p>
<p>Then she flung back her head, with a quick indrawing
of her breath, and looked up at him through a
bright mist that gathered in her eyes. And her face
was radiant.</p>
<p>He went quickly to her, and leaned down to kiss her
hair, her eyes, her lips; and her arms crept once more
around his neck.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>SANGRE DE CRISTO</h3>
</div>
<p>Late October in the San Luis, and the raw day
near its close. Across the melancholy flats the
north wind&rsquo;s plaintive note rose at intervals into a
wailing cry. The thin grasses bent before it, the sagebrush
took on new and fantastic shapes, and danced
like demons to the tune. In gray-brown desolation the
sand dunes rolled away to the foothills, far and violet
and dim. All was cold and bleak and forbidding, and
the sun itself appeared to be retiring eagerly from a
scene so dreary and disheartening.</p>
<p>Then came magic. Sangre de Cristo, sharp against
the eastern sky, began to change its hue. A pink
flush came into the gleaming white. It grew deeper,
darker, more vivid; it spread, and ran in richer and
richer tints along the range. Now it was rose, and
now vermilion, and at last a deep and living scarlet,
staining the snowy slopes, and flowing like new blood
down the gulches and ravines. The foothills caught
the color, and the violets became purple and then red;
the sand dunes caught it, and their gray-browns were
overlaid with crimson; the flats too caught it, and the
sagebrush bending low, and the grass quivering in the
wind were touched with some reflection of that far-reaching
hue. From the green along the river the
color swept, indefinable and dim at first, then by degrees
intensified upon the flats, across the sand dunes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
among the hills until at length it was passionate and
deep and indescribable on the Sangre de Cristo peaks.</p>
<p>A cowboy, searching for lost mavericks, rode slowly
to the top of a low sand dune, reined up his pony, and
sat silent in the midst of this solemn spectacle. He was
not emotional. He was looking for calves, and &ldquo;sore&rdquo;
at not finding them, and hungry, and far from the X
bar O; and night was coming on. But he sat still in
his saddle, removed his flopping sombrero, and looked
toward the east. Bareheaded, the wind stinging his
cheek and flinging dry sand in his eyes, he gazed and
wondered at the familiar but never negligible mystery
of Sangre de Cristo.</p>
<p>But suddenly he rose in his stirrups, and shaded his
eyes with his hand to make out what it was that had
caught his vision in that flood of red among the dunes.
Again it came, a flash of yellow in the red. It was
there, and gone. And then it came and lingered, as if
inviting him, like a jewel in the sand, or rather, like a
challenge and a taunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re back, are you?&rdquo; cried Larkin, of the X
bar O. &ldquo;Well, you c&rsquo;n jest stay there. I&rsquo;m done with
you. You ain&rsquo;t no horse at all, damn you! You&rsquo;re a
devil! But I wonder&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sunnysides was gone. At the same time the
light paled on the distant peaks. The wind blew colder,
and swept the color off the dunes. The flats darkened
under the advancing shades of night. And Larkin,
muttering, put spurs to his pony, and galloped away
toward supper and bed.</p>
